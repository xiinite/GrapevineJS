        You have the tradition legend of Set as told by his followers. In it, Set is cursed by Atum-Ra to forever live in darkness after his defeat by Osiris and Horus. Fearing the sun, Set descended into Du'at wherein he consumed the heart of the serpent Apep and took his power. It was then looking at Nun, the waters of primeval darkness, that Set realized that the Ra had not, in fact, created the world as a thing lesser than himself, but had merely shaped the same substance from which he, himself, was created. Set concluded that all souls differed only in size, but not in kind, and that all beings could someday achieve the same power of the Gods. You know that these "Gods" (Isis, Osiris, Horus and Set's one-time consort Nephythys) are commonly referred to as the Aeons (as well as Atun-Ra, who is also sometimes known as the Demiurge), and that the Setites seek in all ways combat them, as these deities wish to keep their mortal underlings entrapped in the illusion that they must, by nature, be subservient to the Gods. (CbSe [Rev]: 14, 35-39)

        You have heard that, according to Theophidian doctrine, what other Cainites claim as the city of Enoch was, in fact, the city of Annu, which was ruled over by Ra. You further know that Setites claim that Set was not Embraced, but rather that he came to know death by drinking of the waters of Du'at, and that he used his wisdom to create twelve disciples like him, only to have them betray him to Ra. It is said that Set then cursed each of them for their renegade ways, and that this is said among Setites to be the true origin of the thirteen Clans. (CbSe [Rev]: 13-14)

        You know that the Noddist tradition of Cainites claims that Set and Osiris were simple mortal tribesmen in Egypt, and that Set wished to stop their father, Ra, from bringing law to society and hence binding people by it. In some legends Set apparently even tried to bargain with Ra and Osiris, asking that they leave the lands of Upper Egypt to him and his people, that they might be free from law, but they refused. (CbSe [Rev]: 12-13, LS3: 82-83)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard that some claim that Osiris continued his life as a Cainite, and that his progeny formed a secret religious order who attempted to keep the vampiric Beast at bay through ritual and meditative prayer. While you have heard that the Followers of Set have had various skirmishes with these "Children of Osiris," you know little about the group save that it once existed, and that nothing has been heard regarding it in recent nights.

        You have heard that all Setites do not necessarily worship Set, but that many adopt the worship of similar deities within their own religious tradition. You know that many of the Setites of sub-Saharan Africa worship the snake god Damballah, and that Europe has had a long standing cult since classical antiquity known as the Cult of Typhoon Trismegistis, which worships the Greek Titan Typhoon in the guise of the Gods Bacchus, Mars and Pluto.

        You know that Theophidians hope to bring both mortals and Kindred to abandon shame, fear, needfulness, morality and other fetters created by the Aeons, such as that all beings may realize their true potential beyond the material world in which they are bound. You know that Setites, to this end, often attempt to cater to the desires of potential initiates to such an extent that they learn to let go of normal delineations of good and evil. (CbSe [Rev]: 39)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that there are a diversity of opinions as to what the ultimate goal of Setite Theology is, and that philosophy range from the idea that once enlightened, the followers of Set shall rise up to become Gods in their own right to the belief that reality and the Aeons will be transcended once an adherent denies them power. You know that some radical members of the Clan posit that the world that the Demiurge created must be destroyed for Set's vision to realize itself, and that they look to what other Cainites might deem Gehenna with rapt anticipation. (CbSe [Rev]: 39)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Cohort of Wepwawet, a Setite fundamentalist group who seeks to homogenize Setite doctrine and which does missionary work with non-Egyptian Setite groups.
