        You have heard of the First Anarch Revolt, wherein neonate "Anarchs" across Europe rose up and diablerized or killed their elders, and of the Inquisition, and know that both the Sabbat and Camarilla formed as a result of them. You know that the Camarilla is a union of elders and Anarch apologists and the Sabbat are the remaining Anarchs who refused to capitulate. You also know that the Assamites were heavily involved in the affair, although they did not join either Sect. (VtM [Rev]: 44, 65)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that several of the Traditions carry over from a time prior to the Camarilla's inception, where Domain was more of an individual affair, and hence have changed in interpretation over the centuries. You know in particular that the Masquerade was taken from the legendary Laws of the Night as prescribed by Caine.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You can name all of the current Justicars. They are: Jaroslav Paschek (Brujah), Maris Streck (Malkavian), Cock Robin (Nosferatu), Madame Guil (Toreador), Anastasz Di Zagreb (Tremere) Xaviar (gangrel) and Lucinde (Ventrue). You know that they're ruling on Camarilla law is final, save for dictates from the Inner Circle, a mysterious group which allegedly also has one representative for each Clan. You know that the Inner Council meets once every thirteen years in Venice and that it is during this meeting that the new Justicariate is elected. (LotN [Rev]: 17, 221; VtM [Rev]: 67)

        You know how Archons usually operate, and know that each of them is attached (and according to some rumors also blood bound) to one particular Justicar. (LotN [Rev]: 17, 221; VtM [Rev]: 66)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know how the prestation system works in practice fairly well and have a good idea of what actions generally require what boons. (LotN [Rev]: 220-221)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with the position of the Whip, a sort of vice-Primogen who serves as a general gopher for the Primogen they serve and helps to keep their assembled Clan in line. (LotN [Rev]: 219; VtM [Rev]: 38)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that diablerie is almost universally condemned by the Camarilla and that by the dictates of the Inner Council, the only time at which it is always acceptable is when the diablerist is the Sire of the victim, and the act takes place during a formal blood hunt. You know that exceptions are rumored to have been made here and there in instances of war. (VtM [Rev]: 226)

        You have at least heard, in passing, of legendary Camarilla vampires, such as Hardestadt, the Ventrue elder credited with coming up with the original idea for the Camarilla, and Rafeal de Corozon, the Toreador who popularized the idea of the Masquerade in it's current former (GC1: 62)
