        You can identify the basic full set of in-Clan disciplines for every major Clan and know of the existence of most Bloodlines. (LotN [Rev]: 30-59, 132-189; VtM [Rev]: 68-91)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that some Clans seem to have different subsets within their Clan who possess slightly different Disciplines. (VtM [Rev]: 68-91)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know an extremely detailed history of the First Anarch Revolt. You are familiar with various shakers and movers of the resultant political groups, such as Hardestaadt, Tyler, Lugoj, and Gratiano - regardless of Sect or Clan. (Although you may need Lore: Anarch, Lore: Camarilla, or Lore: Sabbat for more details).

        You know that the Tremere originally began as a group of mortal magicians, and that they somehow contrived to make themselves immortal through use of vampiric blood. You know that they usurped and eventually destroyed the now forgotten Clan Salubri, which was allegedly found in the Dark Ages to be entrenched in infernal and diabolistic practices. You know that they also fought a long and protracted war with the Tzimisce during their Clan's infancy known as the War of Omens. (VtM [Rev]: 242)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that, like the Tremere, the Giovanni are also ranked among one of the "new Clans" and that they were originally Embraced by a now defunct Clan known as the Cappadocians. You know that this parent Clan died out sometime during the Rennaisance era after a protracted genocide was waged against them by family Giovanni (similar to that of the Salubri).

        You know of the existance of Revanents - mortal lineages bred into ghouldom. You hear that they are traditionally associated with the Tzimisce of Eastern Europe, but can speculate that other Clans may be able to produce similar occurances.(VtM [Rev]: 20, 255-256; VtM [Rev]: 53)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know the traditional names of most of the Antediluvians, and are familiar with a good sampling of the stories regarding their interactions/relationships. (ex: Saulot, Set and Malkav were brothers, Arikel and Absimiliard were lovers, etc... You may need Clan-specific Lores for more details.)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard (according to Brujah sources) that Carthage was said to be a sort of utopia, where Kindred and Kine lived harmoniously. This claim, however, is counter-acted by numerous other observations that the city was home to infernalist worship and was heavily influenced by the ancient Baali. You know that whatever the case was, it was indeed wiped out by the machinations of Ventrue Rome, in conjunction with a fair amount of Toreador and Malkavian support, and that this to some extent has poured over into Clan tensions up into the Modern Nights.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar (in basic theory) with some of the rarer Paths of Enlightment, most of which are specific to one Clan or another. These include the Path of Blood, a primarilly Assamite Path which focuses on ritual diablerie, Clan loyalty and the position of Clan Assamite as judges over the rest of unworthy Cainite-kind; the Path of Bones, a Giovanni practiced Path said to have originated with the Cappadocians, which emphasis the quiet study of death and detachment from emotions; the Path of Metamophosis, a primarily Tzimisce Path focusing on transhumanist sentiments and bodilly experimentation; and the Path of Night, the signature Path of Clan Lasombra which calls for Cainites to act as pre-ordained agents of evil.(LotN [Rev]: 76-77; CtB: 35-43, 65-74; VtM [Rev]: 286-293)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Inconnu, an almost unheard of Sect of vampires who seek to escape the machinations of the Jyhad altogether and have hence withdrawn from society. You have heard a few words relating them to the State of Golconda. (VtM [Rev]: 44-45)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard several variants on the Gehenna prophecy and know some of the basic portents to watch for (ex: the Time of Thin Blood, the coming of the Red Sign, etc...)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumors that there are ways to regain one's mortality, through acts of great penitence, sacrifice or love. You are fairly certain that none of these rumors will be substantiated anytime soon. (VtM [Rev]: 240-241)
