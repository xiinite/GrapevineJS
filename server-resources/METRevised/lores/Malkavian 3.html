        You have heard the parable regarding Malkav, Set and Saulot. In this story, Saulot goes on a journey to settle an argument between Set and Malkav over the origin of truth. Gifts are exchanged between the brothers. Saulot gives Set his sword, and in return is given Set's staff. To Malkav, he gives his crown, but Malkav, having nothing to give in return, bites his thumb and draws an eye on Saulot's forehead, hence giving the Salubri their characteristic third eye. (CbM [Rev]: 15)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware of Tremere's diablerie of Saulot, and you know that Clan Malkavian nearly joined in the War of Omens along with the Gangrel and Tzimisce to destroy the Usurpers on account of the Malkavian kinship to the Salubri. (CbM [Rev]: 23-24; LS4: 100)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with various theories regarding the Malkavian Madness Network, including that it is the Antediluvian's method of spying upon all of his children.

        You are familiar (or at least as familiar as you can be) with the bizarre cosmological constructs that underpin the sentiments of the Reality Busters. You know that it is claimed that empirical reality has been cut off from the infinite possibility of true reality, due to various godlike creatures destroying their connection to the rest of the universe, and therefore disrupting the flow of potential which powers magical phenomena. You know that it is the aim of the Reality Busters to restore this connection as fully as they are able, and that there are frequent claims that the Fae also attempt to serve a similar function.

        You have heard stories of some Malkavians who have managed to transcend their bodies and "download" themselves onto the Network somehow.
