        You have heard that Veddhartha left the Second City in search of Caine, and that it was after this that the other Antediluvians (Especially those of the Lasombra, Tzimisce, Nosferatu and Setite Clans) rose up and plunged the city into chaos, perpetuating it's fall. You know that Veddhartha has not been heard from since, although some charlatans occasionally claim that he has re-arisen to further their own ends.

        You have a basic understanding of how the Directorate is structured and you are cognizant of the various titles within. You know of: the Stragetegoi (Elders) who directly serve the Ephorate; the Lictors (Troubleshooters) who specialize in handling certain types of situations and are dispatched when a Stragetegoi cannot be present; the Tribunes (Agents at Large) who act as field operatives to the rest of the Directorate; and the Peerage who represent the group of Ventrue in the Clan generally held in good standing. (CbV [Rev]: 39-40)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that the local Ventrue Clan structure within a given city is sometimes referred to as the Gerousia, and that it mirrors in many ways the larger global Directorate. (CbV [Rev]: 42- 45) You know that in recent centuries it has somewhat fallen out of fashion and that only a few cities with significantly large Ventrue populations still cling to this model.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know about the institution of the agoge, the rigorous training system through which Ventrue neonates are prepared for entrance into the Clan. You know, however, that it is typically only adhered to closely by elders, and that not all new Ventrue undergo it. (UnMasqued Canon Only)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware of the Ventrue Ethic of Succor, and know that no Ventrue can refuse a clanmate aid when it is invoked without suffering a loss of dignitas.

        You are aware of the Ventrue Tradition of Accountability, which mirrors the Camarilla tradition of Accounting, only that is connects a Sire's dignitas with that of his childer even after they have been released.

    </li>
