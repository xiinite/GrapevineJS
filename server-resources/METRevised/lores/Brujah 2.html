<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You are aware of the tradition that Brujah was generally stoic, whereas Troile was fiery and passionate. You have further heard that Troile diablerized Brujah, and that his/her punishment for this was his/her subsequent rage. You have heard further that all modern Brujah descended from Troile, which is where they inherited their weakness. You are also rather aware that Troile's gender is often a matter of dispute, and that some traditions place her as Brujah's lover. (CbB [Rev]: 15-16; PGttHC: 18)

    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have heard a few stories and fables about the Clan founder, such as "Brujah and the Wine Seller," "Brujah and the Dead King" or "Brujah and the Three Coins." (CbB [Rev]: 14-15)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You know the basic social classifications generally given to Brujah. These include: the Iconoclasts, who tend to be angry, young and rebellious; the Idealists, who tend to be older, more philosophical and calmer in their politics; and the Individualists, who tend to take the middle ground between the other two camps. (CbB: 13-14; CbB [Rev]: 36-39)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have heard that the destruction of the fabled Carthage was the instigated by Roman Ventrue with the aid of allied Toreador and Malkavians, which is why there is such a long standing grudge between the Brujah and the Clan of Kings. (CbB [Rev]: 17-18; PGttHC:: 20-21)

    <li class="list-group-item">
	You know about the famous Brujah Jeremy MacNeil, who apparently started the Rebellion resulting in the Anarch Free-State and served as it's leader before his death. You also know the rough story of the Second Anarch Revolt in California, and how MacNeil was unjustly beaten by Toreador Prince Don Sebastian's men, which is what sparked the uprising. (CbB: 17-19, 64-65; CbB [Rev]: 26-30; GttA: 22-24)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You know that Jaroslav Paschek is the current Brujah Justicar of the Camarilla. (CotN: 41-43)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You know about the different types of Rants and the multitude of purposes they can serve. You are familiar with Policy Rants, which serve to galvanize the Clan toward a single goal; Debates, which are formalized affairs of rhetoric usually held amongst elders; Prestige Rants, which serve to solidify a single Brujah's standing in the Clan; Rally Rants, which serve to whip Brujah into an appropriate furor for an oncoming task; and Spite Rants, which serve to punish or ostracize a Clan member. (CbB: 25-28; CbB [Rev]: 41-42)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You are familiar with the practice of "running the Gauntlet," a punishment usually invoked at Rants in which a disgraced Brujah must walk through a crowd of his/her clanmates, who beat them continuously until they reach the end of a set path. You know that those who actually walk out of a gauntlet un-torpid tend to be considered absolved of the crime, and probably have gained some cred for their endurance. (CbB: 28; CbB [Rev]: 42)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have at least heard, in passing, of legendary Brujah such as: Patricia Boilingbrooke, the lover of Wat Tyler and one of the first and most famous figures in the Anarch Revolt; and Etheyra, the Carthaginian who supposedly betrayed the city to Rome. (CbB [Rev]: 22, 98-99; CotI: 21-23; GttA: 12)
