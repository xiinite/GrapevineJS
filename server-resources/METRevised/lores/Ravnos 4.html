<h3>Lore: Ravnos x4</h3>

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware of some of the Indian myths regarding Cainites that are told outside of the Ravnos, such as claims that the death god Yama cursed his sons for displeasing them, telling them that they might never come to his kingdom, and that these children became the pitis (or forefathers) of Indian Cainites. Another describes demonic princes, who managed to rise again after the gods killed them, because they had stolen the Nectar of Immortality. In general, many of the non-Ravnos myths seem to characterize vampires as demons or fallen Gods - a close observer might try to draw some sort of connection between these myths and those regarding the asuratizayya.

        You have heard a Romani story in which Dracian sought to overcome his curse by crafting a beautiful tree - whose fruit was said to be able to forever slake a Cainite's thirst for blood. In these legends, it is Daenna who eventually eats of the fruit after Dracian's destruction by Amriat. This gift eventually allows her children, the gypsies, to inherit her magic. In these legends, she is also said to have taken a stone covered in Dracian's blood and to have used it to Embrace a young man named Ravnos, by placing it in his mouth as she stabbed him in the heart. This, of course, forms yet another apocrypha as to how the Clan Antediluvian came to be, and it seems to merge the stories of Dracian and Ravnos together. (Gypsy: 14-19, 89-90)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard some scant few phralmulo stories which mention the figure of Punjika, who was said to be the uncle of Ravnos, and some traditional Romani stories which mention the figure of Sarrath, who was said to be the brother-in-law of Dracian. You have heard claims that such characters are often said to have numbered among the first werewolves, although there is little to substantiate this. You also know that these two figures might, in fact, be the same person if you believe the legends stating that Ravnos was Dracian's "son." (CbR: 14-20; Gypsy: 16-18, 89-90)

        You have heard the assertion made that Rakshasa was not in fact Embraced by Zapathasura, and was merely a ghoul of the Antediluvian, and that it was because of this that he was able to infiltrate the asuratizayya. You have further heard that because of this, many acts attribute to Rakshasa are in actuality better tied to Ramessu. (CbR [Rev]: 18, 23)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that some records indicate that Ramessu eventually relocated to Egypt, where he created the brood that would later be known as the Alexanderites, and apparently endured numerous conflicts with Setites over territory. You hear that he eventually came to fancy himself as a Pharonic God, and that his followers largely abandoned any of their Vedic roots. (CbR: 21; CbR [Rev]: 23; PGttLC: 52; LS4: 22-24)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that Ravana's trafficking with the infernal allowed him to seduce a large number of Cainites and asuratizayya into his following, and that he eventually sought to tempt Zapathasura with his power. According to legend, Zapathasura is said to have grown violent at such and offer, and after attempting to strike Ravana, found that there was nobody in front of him, and thereafter was taken by the grip of his first long torpor. (CbR [Rev]: 23)

        You are aware that there is little hard archeological evidence to support the theory that Harrapa and Mohenjo-Daro were at war, and that many scholars believe that even in antiquity, the supernaturals who might have inhabited these cities could not have risked open warfare, and must rather have conducted their conflicts via ghouls and mortal followers. (CbR: 21; CbR [Rev]: 21)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have are aware that there was a schism among the Bashirites that led to their echscatalogical fanaticism, and that Bashir is said to have initially preached non-intervention with regards to the end times. It was apparently his childe Varsik who gave the call to "force God's hand" by plunging the world into chaos. You are aware that there existed a small splinter Sect amongst the group known as the "Lambs of Bashir" who claimed to preserve their founder's original teachings. (PGttLC: 53-54; LS4: 13)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Yoryari, a small splinter group of the Sybarites who are said to have founded a number of now forgotten philosophical variants on the false Path of Paradox, namely a belief that the primordial energy of change (weig) is held in all things, and that it needs to be released in order to transform reality. There are many who claim that this Path of Paradox is a comparatively less bastardized version of the Mayaparisatya as was handed down to the Yoyari by Romani-associated Chandalas coming out of India. (CbR: 41; CbR [Rev]: 27; PGttLC: 53-54; LS4: 14-15)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Urmen, a rare bloodline of Ravnos who claim to have trafficked with the Fae, in order that they might drink their blood. You have heard rumors to the effect that the power of Chimestry is used by the Urmen to subdue such creatures, who are said to always act as though chimera cast upon them are real, and you also know that the Urmen have a mortal Romani bloodline which shares their name and some of their beliefs with them, much like the Phuri Dae. (CbR: 33; Gypsy: 26-28)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Tsurara, the group from which the Wuzho claim their lineage is, in fact, a Romani collective formed in the 1940s. In its mortal incarnation, the Tsurara vehemently hate all phralmulo and work towards their destruction, feeling that by accepting the Embrace, they have disgraced their Romani blood. (Gypsy: 101-102)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that while Ravnos seldom get involved in other Clans politics, they were often active assistants in the Tremere genocide of the Salubri, as many Ravnos on the Western Path of Paradox believed that the frequent push by the Salubri to look toward Golconda was blasphemously antithetical to the svadharma of Cainites. (LS4: 30, 44-45)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that the Ravnos were amongst the hardest-hit Clans of World War II, due to the Nazi Holocaust and its targeting of gypsies amongst the unfit. You know that some Ravnos claim that Germany was being deliberately manipulated by Ventrue or Tremere forces at the time who wished to deliberately wipe out the Clan - but that these assertions are universally dismissed both within and outside of the Clan as being nothing more than conspiracy theories. (CbR: 24-26; CbR [Rev]: 33)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have hear that the Bhopal Disaster of 1984, which exposed more than 500,000 people to toxic methyl isocyanate gas, was caused by militant Kshatriyas attempting to engage in mass-Embrace tactics against groups of asuratizayya. (CbR [Rev]: 34)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of Ravnos Neve, Cainites that appear to have been native to North America at the time when Europeans first arrived and to have possessed powers similar to the Ravnos of Europe and India. You know that these native Ravnos often associated themselves with native groups who identified with totemic trickster creatures, such as Raven or Coyote. (CbR: 23-24)

        You've heard of some of the fairly obscure Ravnos of note, such as: Callirus, an infamous Spanish con-artist who earned his Embrace after successfully posing as a Kindred for a full year; Karmenita Yoyari, the founder of the Yoyari line; Papa Legba, a voodoun practitioner who takes on the name and mannerisms of a famous trickster loa; and Spirit Creek, a small Ravnos-led coterie of underground musicians who are noted as runners and informants for a wide variety of patrons (CbR [Rev]: 16-17, 31, 47; 100; CotN: 84-85; PGttLC: 56;)
