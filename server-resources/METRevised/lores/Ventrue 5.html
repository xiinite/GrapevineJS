        You are aware as to who currently serves on the Directorate and as to what their policies generally are.

        You have heard claims that the mysterious Inconnu was originally a Ventrue organization, formed after the fall of Rome.

        You have heard that Fabrizio Ulfia put pressure on various factions within the medieval Church to wipe out the Albegensian Heresey (associated with the Toreador at the time), and that these actions might have exacerbated, or even led to the Inquisition.

        You know that Clan Ventrue, though Almanov and the Conspiracy of Issac, backed an attempt by the Giovanni to destroy the Antediluvian of the now extinct Clan of Death (The Cappadocians) and to usurp the Clan's place among Cainites. You further know that the Ephorate of the time simultaneously backed Hardestadt and the nascent Camarilla in an attempt to halt such a Conspiracy. Their motivations for such duplicity are somewhat hazy, but you're aware that the elders of the era expected the backlash from either a successful or failed attempt on the life of a Clan Founder to help galvanize efforts to found the Camarilla.

        You have heard of the daeva, and know that Caine charged Veddhartha with overcoming them. They are allegedly a group of all the mightiest of the supernaturals on Earth and include, but are not limited to, the Antediluvians. You are aware that the Knights of the Blood was one of many Ventrue groups dedicated to their destruction.
