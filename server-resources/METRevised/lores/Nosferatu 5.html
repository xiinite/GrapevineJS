        You know the names of as many Niktuku as it is possible to hear tell of. You have heard of Abraxes, Lord of Mists; Nuckalavee the Skinless; Gorgo; She Who Screams in Darkness; and Echnida, the Mother of Foulness. (CbN: 17)

        You know that Baba Yaga resisted her Embrace at the hands of Absimilliard and has long sought the death of the Antediluvian. You are aware that she summoned the seven Zmei (Goluko, Gregornous, Illyana, Rustarin, Shazear and Trevero) and Koschei the Deathless (a demon who is said to have formed when one of the five claws of the devil dragged across the earth on his way to hell) in her battle against him. You have heard rumors that Absimilliard made a pact with these forces to avoid his own destruction. (CbN [Rev]: 100; RaR: 84-89, 91-99)

        You know that Baba Yaga did not die at the hands of lycanthropes (as some rumors say), but that she was killed by one of the Nictuku, who was active in Russia at the time. You have heard that the creature took the form of a small girl with a mark of a crescent moon on her neck, and that it went by the name of "Vassalisa." (NoP: 93-100)

        You know that Cock Robin is the childe of former Justicar Alonso Cristo Petradon de Seville - although this is a close guarded secret, given the nepotism it betrays as present amongst the Camarilla's upper echelons. (CoTN: 45-56)
