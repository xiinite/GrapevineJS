	You have heard of the First Anarch Revolt, wherein neonate "Anarchs" across Europe rose up and diablerized or killed their elders, and of the Inquisition, and know that both the Sabbat and Camarilla formed as a result of them. You know that the Camarilla is a union of elders and Anarch apologists and the Sabbat are the remaining Anarchs who refused to capitulate. (LotN [Rev]: 18; VtM [Rev]: 44, 65, 82)

	You know the story of the Second Anarch Revolt in detail, which started when Brujah Jeremy MacNeil was unjustly beaten by Toreador Prince Don Sebastian's men in 1944, precipitating mass riots, the death of Toreador Prince Don Sebatian and the eventual formation of the Free State. You are aware that the Free State has pretty much disbanded with the Cathayan invasion and the formation of the New Promise Mandarinate. (CbB: 17-19, 64-65; CbB [Rev]: 26-30; GttA: 22-24)

    You know of various loose positions within Anarch culture, such as: Emissaries, who are diplomats who negotiate between Anarchs and other political groups; Sweepers (also called proctors, Sherlocks or abaci), who are Anarch census takers of a sort; and Chameleons (also called Bonds, moles or subs), who are Anarch moles in positions of power in other Sects. (GttA: 53-55)

	You know that East Coast Anarchs tend to be less politically active (i.e. less inclined toward burning shit down), and tend to focus more on intellectual pursuits than their Western counterparts. You know that this occassionally also gives Anarchs of the West Coast the perception that they are not as effective as they are (i.e. complete pussies). (GttA: 120-125)

	You know about most of the Anarch popular games that have been devised in addition to Nines, such as Sixty-Nines, an unpleasant variant of Nines in which one participant doesn't know it's a game; Bear-Baiting, the delicate art of goading elders to Frenzy in Elysium while adhereing to the rules; LA Roulette, in which two Anarchs duke it out by hitting one another with a bat until one concedes; and Gotcha, wherein you try to convince a mortal that he's accidentally killed you.
