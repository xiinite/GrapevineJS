        You know much of Gratiano's personal history, namely that he was originally a 12th Century Italian nobleman and that he caught the Antediluvian's attention through attempting to orchestrate an partial overthrow of German authority over Northern Italy, and that it was only after he was imprisoned and tortured that he consented to the Embrace.(CbL: 18; CbL [Rev]: 21-23; CotI: 38-41; PGttHC: 35)

    <li class="list-group-item">

        You know that the Lasombra in China went through several periods of isolation from their Western brethren, and that while they are not a separate bloodline by any stretch of the imagination, they are noted to be "peculiar" in their outlook. You are aware that Chinese Lasombra were allegedly heavy proponents of Confucianism. (CbL [Rev]: 30-32)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">

        You have heard of the Black Angels or Angelis Ater, a faction stemming from a medieval group of wanton antagonizers and infernalists who who claim to be agents of the devil and hence enact violence and depredation without law or reason. You know that the Angellis believe that Obtenebration is an art stemming from Lucifer himself, and that all Lasombra are inherently linked to hell. (CbL [Rev]: 48-50; LS1: 22-23)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are intimately familiar with all of the variants of the Path of Night, including the more obscure Path of Allied Night, which argues a collective Lasombra oneness in the Abyss and is often favored by occultists and Abyss mystics; and the Path of Lightless Night, a rare and esoteric Path which focuses on total immersion in actual physical darkness.

        You know of some of the less popular or immediately visible factions within the Clan, such as: the "Corsairs," who take to sea-faring unlives as pirates or explorers; the "Transhumanists," who claim that Cainites should constantly seek to evolve and expand themselves, and who often prove close bedfellows with the Tzimisce as a result of their shared interests; the "Fatalists," who believe that their position in society is immovable, and that more powerful elders with always have control in spite of the Sabbat's best efforts; and the "Doomed," who refuse to acknowledge any Masquerade by openly and sometimes suicidally flaunting their vampiric nature.

        You have heard of the enigmatic Kiasyd, as Bloodline of strange seldom-seen scholars who have a nominal alliance with the Sabbat. You know that the Lasombra have some connection to them. (LS1: 28-289)

        You know that some Lasombra antitribu, rather than holding to the Camarilla, believe themselves to be agents of the Antediluvian itself, and claim that the Eldest still lives. These "Radicals" are often extremely inhumane and brutal and claim no Sect alliance. (CbL [Rev]: 56)
