<h3>Lore: Tremere x4</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that not only did Tremere destroy Saulot, but that he also diablerized him, hence giving himself the power of an Antediluvian.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that Goratrix imprisoned, tortured and killed a Tzimisce in the process of creating the mystical potion, and it is for this, for the perceived threat to their secrets of sorcery and for the perceived invasion of their territory that the Tzimisce declared war.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Gargoyles were made by perpetrating terrible and painful experiments upon Tzimisce, Gangrel and Nosferatu prisoners, and that the end result was far more sapient than the creators intended. You know that originally fourteen of them were created at the Chantry Ceoris, and that over a hundred Kindred died to create them.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that Goratrix, himself, was not killed with the rest of the Tremere antitribu.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of the obscure or even forbidden Houses that operate within Clan Tremere, such as: House of High Saturday (voudoun and Necromancy - open to Non-Tremere), and the Horned Society (infernalism).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the forbidden and supposedly now defunct House Quaesitor, a throwback from the Order of Hermes, which supposedly still holds the mortal "Code of Hermes" over the Tremere Code. You know that all Tremere found to be part of this organization (should it even exist) would be immediately shipped off to Vienna.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of some of the very secretive, forbidden or even now defunct social groups that once existed within Clan Tremere, such as: The Brothers of Absinthe, those who claim the ability to achieve mystical enlightenment through imbibing a specially prepared version of absinthe; the Illuminated Brotherhood, a group that believes in the existence of ancient enlightened beings known as the Old Ones and seeks to learn from them; the Order of Naturists (Defunct), those interested with Druidic sorcery and nature magic; the Humanus League (Defunct), those who wished to reverse the curse of vampirism and return to humanity; the Golden Path of Harmony (Defunct), those who wished to foster unity and cooperation within Clan Tremere; and the Order of the Wyrm, a heretical few who believe that Tremere himself has been replaced by another being and seek to destroy it.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that at certain points in the Tremere hierarchy, such as the rank of Pontifex, the only way to advance is through Certamen to the death.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with the Duchevsky, the one Tremere Revanant bloodline, and you know that they originated with the Tzimisce family known as the Krevcheski. You know furthermore that they are supposedly never Embraced, but rather only employed for their scholarly skills.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of some of the fairly obscure Tremere of note, such as Masika St. John, the innovative Madagasgar neonate who created the Path of Technomancy.
