        You've heard most of the stories regarding Ennoia. You've heard that she and Churka (yet another name for the Ravnos Antediluvian) were the twin siblings of an ancient and unknown Goddess (possibly Lillith), and that they fought a protracted battle on one journey over whom should greet their mother first, and that it was through the choosing of champions for this battle that the Gangrel and Ravnos lines were formed. According to this story it is claimed that Ennoia lost the battle when her two greatest warriors betrayed her, and was hence driven into seclusion by the onslaught of Churka. It is said that the two traitor warriors went on to found the Lhiannan and Laibon bloodlines. (CbG [Rev]: 13; LS3: 12)

        You are aware that the Romani have their own myths regarding the Gangrel, and have heard the story of Jorsca and Lareth, a gypsy boy and a wolf who hungered for Jorsca's blood. In the story, Jorsca was able to trick Lareth into turning himself into a man and then into staying up all night puzzling over his tricks, but the youth then saved him from destruction by the sun by hiding him in his wagon. In return, Lareth vowed that his people should never prey on Jorsca's. (Gypsy: 38-39)

        You know that the Tremere at some point performed experimentations upon Gangrel to produce the Gargoyle bloodline, and that this resulted in both a rather bloody conflict and a Gangrel alliance with the Tzimisce in the Dark Ages. (CbG [Rev]: 17-18)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard that the City Gangrel might have had their origins in the cities of medieval Rome and Constantinople, where members of the Clan took to stalking the sewers and waterways, much like the Nosferatu. It was due to this that they eventually came to embrace the Discipline of Obfuscate rather than Fortitude. (LS3: 32)

        You know a fair amount about the Anda and are aware that they were wiped out by Cathayan (also called Kuei Jin or Wan Kuei) forces coming out of the borderlands of China at the end of the Yuan Dynasty. You know that their curse differed from the traditional bane of the Gangrel in that they were compelled to always wander, that they were said to have strange powers known as Ma which better adapted them to raider life on the steppes, and that they claimed lineage from the earth Goddess Itügen and her children. (WotS: 42, 50-54)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Lhiannan were wiped out largely with the advent of Christianity, and have heard that they claimed a lineage different from other Cainites, declaring themselves to be descended from some mysterious figure known only as "The Crone." (PGttLC: 129)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of a Gangrel Bloodline even more obscured by history than the Lhiannan, known as the Noiad, who were rumored to have been ancient creatures that dwelt in symbiotic harmony with the Samí people of Lappland. You know that like many of the other ancient Gangrel variants, the Noaid are all presumed to be long gone. (DA-E: 151)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know a fair amount about historical Einherjar culture, and are aware of the idea that the condition of becoming "afterganger" was thought of as an honor amongst them - a paradigm much in conflict with the standard guilt-inducing myth of Caine. You know that the belief was commonly held among them that they were chosen by Odin to live in Middle-gard (Earth) until they should see Ragnarok, and that many of them ruled openly amongst their human counterparts. You have heard of one such ruler known as the "All-High" who led a sizable cult of personality near Uppsala, and is said to be linked to the enigmatic modern Waelkyrige.(WotS: 42, 50-54)

        You know that the Ahrimanes were all originally Gangrel, and that their blood was somehow transformed through a shamanic ritual. You are aware that they were unable to Embrace childer or create blood bonds, and that they allegedly had access to bizarre forms of spirit magic. (CbG [Rev]: 48)

        You are aware of the Path of Harmony, the second Path of Enlightenment developed from the Road of the Beast. Unlike the Path of the Feral Heart, you know that it preaches a less violent manner of coexistence with the natural order. (CtB: 31-35)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that Xaviar apparently saw and confronted some being of great power which convinced him of the reality of the Antediluvians. (CbG [Rev]: 43-44)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that back before the fall of Rome, there was a precedent for something known as the Grand Gather, which would summon the vast majority of the Clan to one location, potentially for weeks on end. It was seldom called, as whomever was bold enough to call one would have to stand to any challenge that another Gangrel put before him, or be slain. You know that a leader at a Grand Gather could, if successful, call for a Grand Revel, which would bring down the whole wrath of the Clan on one single target. (LS3: 14)

        You've heard of some of the fairly obscure Gangrel of note, such as: Beckett, a famed Noddist explorer/historian; Constantus, the founder of the Invicti; Fra' Bernando, the founder of the Luppetti di Gubbio; Marcus "The Egyptian" Sextus, the Sire of Inyanga, who managed to preempt Arnulf's Roman invasions by fleeing to Africa; Matasuntha, a Hunnish warlord who went on a rampage across Europe in 400 AD; and Olaf and Karl, the two Vinlanders who supposedly instigated the spread of Gangrel throughout North America around 1200 AD. (CbG [Rev]: 16, 21).
