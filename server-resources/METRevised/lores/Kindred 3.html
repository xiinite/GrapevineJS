    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that there are a few unsettling rumors of ghouls going rogue and betraying their masters, but that these reports are too far and few between to disuade the practice of ghouling. You have also heard whispers of ways though which a mortal bloodline might be manipulated as such that members of it's lineage are born into ghouldom. although you have no idea as to how such a thing might be done.(LotN [Rev]: 20, 255-256; VtM [Rev]: 53)

        You know some of the variant details of the Caine mythos, and have either read or heard quoted fragments of the Book of Nod. You have also heard some words regarding the significance of Lillith as Caine's counterpart, and have heard that she was the being that taught Caine the Disciplines common to all vampires.

        You know that the Second City was founded in imitation of Enoch after the Deluge destroyed the First City, and that it was supposedly here that that the Antediluvians rose up in civil war and devoured their progenitors.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar (in basic theory) with some of the more common Paths of Enlightment, such as the Path of Caine, a Path which concerns itself with Noddist teachings and instructs it's followers to hold Caine as the example of the ideal vampire; the Path of Cathari, a Path based loosely on the Albegensian heresies of the middle ages, which extols vice and indulgence in the physical world; the Path of Death and the Soul, a Path based arround the ungoing meticulous study of death and the dying; the Path of the Feral Heart, the Path of the Feral Heart, a Path based on the predatory nature of Cainites and the full embrace of their animal instincts; the Path of Honorable Accord, a Path based around concepts of codified ethics and fealty; and The Path of Power and the Inner Voice, a Path based around the acquisition of power and the importance of individual ambition; and the Path of Redemption, which exhorts Cainites to attempt to redeem themselves in the eyes of a Christian God. You have also heard of the Path of Typhon, a Path originating with the Followers of Set, which is intrinsically tied to the cultic practices native to that Clan.(LotN [Rev]: 79; LotN-SG [Rev]: 76-83, 86-90, 93-95; GttS [Rev]: 127-134, 137-141, 144-146; CtB: 33-35, 43-61, 82-91, 95-100; VtM [Rev]: 294-295)

        You have heard of the Path of Evil Revelations, in which a vampire pledges obediance to an infernal overlord in both an attempt to stave off the advances of the Beast and in exchange for demonic powers. You have heard that infernalists are sometimes capable of learning a damned form of blood magic known as Dark Thaumaturgy (LotN-SG [Rev]: 90-93; GttS: 141-144; CtB: 61-65)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of Golconda seekers, and know that there are enough who claim to have attained this state of perfection to lend some credence to the stories. You know that a vampire in Golconda need never fear Frenzy or Rotschreck and requires far less blood to sustain themselves. (LotN [Rev]: 210; VtM [Rev]: 230-231)
