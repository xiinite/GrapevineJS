<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard versions of the story of Absimilliard which claim that Zillah was smitten with Absimilliard's handsome appearance, and that it was she that hunted him that she might Embrace him. You have further heard that in his siege against the First City, he was not quite able to drink all of Zillah's blood, and that as a result he did not inherit her power. (CbN: 13, 16)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that Absimilliard believes that once all of his childer are slain, he can offer up his dead brood in sacrifice to Caine, whom he believes will then remove his curse. (CbN: 16-17)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that some believe that Absimilliard is relatively uninvolved in the quest of the Niktuku, and that they took their quest for revenge upon themselves, believing that Zillah would have fallen had the Matriarch and her childer stood with them. (PGttLC: 44)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that elders often use the threat of the Nictuku to force the decisions of their childer through fear, and that many accounts of Nictuku are, in fact, falsified. (LS4: 49)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have claims that "the Matriarch" was but one of three childer responsible for the current Nosferatu bloodline, and that the other two were a figure known as the "Old Crone" or "Little Grandmother", and a third childe yet unnamed. You know that rumors of these other two figures circulated in the middle ages, and that there were connections made to the classical Pagan motif of the Maiden, Mother and Crone. You are further aware that many Kindred originating in non-European regions do not claim lineage from the Matriarch and, in fact, have even gone so far as to title themselves "Niktuku" because of this, in spite of bearing no resemblance to the creatures of legend. (LS4: 51-52)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that the Nosferatu apparently had large populations in Egypt and Africa at one point in time, and that these Kindred supposedly dwelt for the most part above ground, unlike their European counterparts. You know that Kindred explorers were also befuddled to find native Nosferatu already on the American continents during the Age of Exploration, and have heard that these indigenous Nosferatu are said to have given rise to the Algonquin legends of manitou (spirits) that ate the essence of other beings. (CbN [Rev]: 21, 24-25; 30-37)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Nosferatu of Rome (the Fossori) were at one time engaged in a lengthy feud with the now extinct Clan of Death (the Cappadocians) regarding possession of the Catacombs beneath the city. (PGttLC: 46-47)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of the War of Omens, and you know that the Nosferatu at the time allied themselves with Clan Tzimisce against the nascent Tremere. (LS4: 72)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with some of the trends in the Nosferatu deformity, and are aware that the appearance of a Nosferatu can occasionally be traced to old regional communities. You know that the Parisii (Parisian Nosferatu) tend to have nearly translucent skin revealing their veins beneath and that the Lazarenes (Istanbul Nosferatu - formerly associated with the hospitaler knight order of St. Lazarus) have deformities consistent with very late stage leprosy. You have also heard that there were formerly some other "breeds" of Nosferatu, whose deformities had vastly different appearances than those common today - although nobody has heard recent tell of them. (LS4: 59-61, 78; PGttLC: 47-48)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard the cosmological mythology perpetuated by some theologically inclined neonate Nosferatu , who claim that the surface world is, in fact, the manifest hell, and that all people who walk upon it are cleverly disguise devils. The Nosferatu, they claim, by shedding their disguise, may now burrow downward in search of paradise. (CbN: 39)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know several of the more archaic traditions of the Nosferatu. You have heard that it once was held as common etiquette that any Nosferatu must give shelter to a clanmate for three nights without payment; that broods of Portuguese Nosferatu would adopt orphaned neonates by "re-Embracing" them (draining them and collectively feeding the foundling their blood); that brood alliances in Northern Europe were once cemented by exchanging two broodmates as hostages; and that in a few remote areas Nosferatu would conduct mock "marriages" of leaders to join broods together as one. (LS4: 56)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the ancient institution known as the Warrener's Guild, which was founded by Zelios as an architectural school for the Clan. You also know that the largely discontinued profession of being a warrener involved traveling to various urban broods to aid them in making appropriate accommodations. (PGttLC: 46, 220)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that some elders in Europe previously were known to hire out Nosferatu to administer the Embrace upon their ghouls as a form of torture before they were disposed of. (LS4: 54)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of "living paths" - generations of trained animals in Nosferatu-held regions who can recognize members of the Clan and lead them through spans of wilderness. (LS4: 55)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that Rasputin was a Nosferatu, although this is disputed by other Clans. (BbN: 52-53)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that the Nosferatu have been credited with Embracing such historical figures as: Yima, the great king of Zoroastrian scripture. (LS4: 52)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard a few tall tales regarding Nosferatu culture influence. You have been told that the original Dickinsonian character of Fagin, was, in fact inspired by Nosferatu blood cults similar to the fictional organization in Oliver Twist. You further have heard that the infamous Bat Boy of Weekly World News fame was an escaped Nosferatu childe. (CbN: 57; CbN [Rev]: 27)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that Baba Yaga's influence over Russia was considerable, even for an elder of her age, and have heard that from the time of her reawakening in the mid-1980s through her alleged demise in 1998, communications with Russian Kindred came to an absolute standstill due to some effect known only as the "Shadow Curtain." You are also aware that the Iron Hag is said to have a long-standing feud with the Ravnos elder Durga Syn, and that she is responsible for the death of the entire Brujah Council that formerly governed Soviet Russia. (CbB [Rev]: 30-33; CbN [Rev]: 100; CotI: 55-57; NoP: 100-102; RaR: 89-91)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that Josef von Bauren was the Nosferatu representative amongst the founding members of the Camarilla, and that he sat on the original Inner Council. (CbN [Rev]: 26; GC1: 51-61; GC2 17-20; GC3 15-16)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have at least heard, in passing, of famous Nosferatu such as: Alonso Cristo Petradon de Seville, the former Nosferatu Justicar of the Camarilla, whose assassination in 1997 still remains a mystery; Ferderico DiPadua, the famous Camarilla archon who is said to have preempted an Anarch attack at the Convention of Thorns; Khalid, the former Nosferatu Primogen of Chicago; Rabbat, an anathema hunted for her ability to spread a plague contractable by Cainites; and Zelios, a famous architect and geomancer who is said to be responsible for everything from the Tzimisce citadels of the old world to the Tremere chantry of Ceoris. (CbN [Rev]: 26, 98-99; CotN: 53-54; LS4: 57; KmW: 20-25; VtM [Rev]: 66)
