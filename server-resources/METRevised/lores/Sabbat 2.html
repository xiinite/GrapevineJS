        You have been told of the Antediluvians, and of the threat they pose. You have heard of the First Anarch Revolt, wherin neonates across Europe rose up and diablerized or killed their elders (the Tzimisce and Lasombra Antediluvians supposedly included), and you know that both the Sabbat and Camarilla formed as a result of it. (LotN [Rev]: 18; VtM [Rev]: 44, 65, 82)

        You have heard of the various major political camps within the Sabbat, such as: the Status Quo; the Moderates; the Loyalists, who wish to adhere to the original intents of the first Anarch movement and seek freedom from elder oppression; and the Ultra-Conservatives, who believe the purpose of the Sabbat should be the battle against the Antediluvians alone, and have little regard for individual liberty in this war.

        You are familiar (in basic theory) with some of the more common Paths of Enlightment found within the Sabbat, such as the Path of Caine, a Path which concerns itself with Noddist teachings and instructs it's followers to hold Caine as the example of the ideal vampire; the Path of Cathari, the Path of Cathari, a Path based loosely on the Albegensian heresies of the middle ages, which extols vice and indulgence in the physical world; the Path of Death and the Soul, a Path based arround the ungoing meticulous study of death and the dying; the Path of the Feral Heart, a Path based on the predatory nature of Cainites and the full embrace of their animal instincts; the Path of Honorable Accord, a Path based around concepts of codified ethics and fealty; and the Path of Power and the Inner Voice, a Path based around the acquisition of power and the importance of individual ambition.

You know that followers of this Path are considered heretics to the Sect and ought be executed very very very soon. (LotN-SG [Rev]: 90-93; GttS: 141-144; CtB: 61-65)
