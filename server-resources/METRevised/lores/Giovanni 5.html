        You know a little about the legendary Sargon Fragment which Ambrogino Giovanni seeks, and know it to be a Chaldean text which contains various ritual magics - magics potent enough that they just might allow somebody to assume the Godhead as Cappadocius intended.

        You know that the Conspiracy of Isaac was quite nearly thwarted by the Founding members of the (then unformed) Camarilla. This ought be a little disconcerting, given the concerted Ventrue influence behind both the Conspiracy and the Ivory Tower. You suspect that the Clan of Kings had it's hand in the Giovanni's formation to a greater extent than anyone is likely to admit... (GC1: 8-9)
