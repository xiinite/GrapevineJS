        You have heard legends that state that the Tzimisce Antediluvian placed some of it's flesh into each of its childer, and that through this, the creature may experience the sensations of each member of the Clan. You have also heard very unsettling rumors that indicate that due to this the Antediluvian would be able to consume or control any of it's descendants as well. Legends say it did this to the first of its childer, Gallod.

        You know that the War of Omens actually was started by a conflict between the Ventrue Nova Arpad and the Tzimisce methuselah Ionache over the territory of Hungry, and that it was Jürgen of Magdeburg, another Ventrue, who briefly led one of the major onslaughts against the Clan.

        You are aware that many Tzimisce were used during the War of Omens in Tremere experiments to create the bloodline of the gargoyles.

        You have heard legends that Kupala once opposed the shape shifting Lupines of the region, and that they sought to imprison it by burying it under the earth. They required so much earth to be heap on top of it though, they they formed the Carpathian mountains in the process.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the connection to Kupala and to sorcery is often mirrored in a Tzimisce's connection to the soil, and that some Tzmisice are said to be quieted in their rest only by the soil of Kupala's lands, even if they weren't born there. It is said that these childer, if not killed for perceived weakness, make excellent koldun.

        You've heard that Ruthven has made wild claims stating that Lugoj was somehow overtaken by the eldest during the diablerie and that something terrible (and yet strangely reminiscent of the Cathedral of Flesh) lurks under New York's sewers. Few believe him.

        You know that the Oprichniki favor the Disciplines of Auspex, Obfuscate and Vicissitude, and that each one of them is said to be under a curse where they are pursued by the ghosts of the dead.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Revanent bloodlines which now longer serve the Tzmisice or who went extinct. THese include: the Krevcheski, who defected to the Tremere and became the Duschevsky; the Khavi, who served the elder Bylebog, but were eventually slain by invading Teutonic Knights; the Vlaszy, who sided with the nascent Camarilla during the revolt and were hunted down and killed; and the Basarab, who were systematically slaughtered due to the interventions of Vlad Tepes (Dracula) who came from their lineage.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of some of the fairly obscure Tzimisce of note, such as: Doktor Tötentanz, a Nazi sympathizing torturer of the Black Hand; and Corine Marcón, a renowned fashion designer, who even boasts some Camarilla clientele.
