    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard tales of the First Age, in which the Aeons walked among mortal men, and have heard all manner of stories relating as to why this is no longer so. Theories range from mankind becoming so dulled with subservience that they could no longer communicate with their Gods on a one-to-one basis to the Aeons fleeing to become incorporeal spirits, perhaps in fear of the newly enlightened Set. You have heard legends say that the free will of men with regards to the Gods may, in fact have been a mistake by the Demiurge, and that Atun-Ra never intended to breathe so much life into his creations that they could someday oppose him. (CbN [Rev]: 39)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Osirians apparently could claim control of Egypt during the 12th and 13th Dynasties (beginning with Amenemhat I), the reign of Ahmose I, and the famous Amarna period under Akehnaten (in which the Ra, the sun, came to be worshipped alone, apart from other Gods). You have heard, furthermore, that the Setites in Egypt acted directly to dismantle Akehnaten's reign, and that they may have gone so far to Embrace his wife Nefertiti.(CbSe [Rev]: 15-18)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumors that the Hyskos rule of Egypt was not entirely pro-Setite, and are aware of connections that are sometimes drawn between the Hyskos and the Lasombra's claim to rule over the "sea people." (CbN: 24-32 ???)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that during the Persian conquests of Egypt in the Late Period (525 BCE - 404 BCE), the region apparently endured control by Clan Assamite, and that the eventual coming of Alexander the Great was lauded by many as the will of Set to free them from the Assamite occupation. You have heard that many among the Followers of Set view Alexander as possessing the spark of divinity, and that some have gone so far as to call him the "Son of Set." (CbSe [Rev]: 16-17; CbN: 35; LS3: 86)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard that some Setite elders disputed the spread of Setitism to non-Egyptians during the Roman Empire, but that it was rumored that Set himself spoke on the matter and cast his will with the lot of the young then neonates of the time who favored the expansion to other cultures. (CbSe [Rev]: 18-19)>

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that Set reportedly disappeared from his resting place in Tanis sometime during the time of the early Roman Empire (a superstitious few claim that the time frame coincided with the crucifixion of Christ), and that for one week preceding his disappearance, he sent feverish visions to the elders of the Clan (Six of the Eternals apparently fell into a non-ending torpor during this time), which have since been interpreted as prophecy. You know that there are approximately three-hundred of these prophecies transcribed, and that they are closely guarded by the Clan. (CbSe [Rev]: 19-20, LS3: 87)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard that the fall of Tanis was preceded by many ill omens and auspices, including the year of 539 CE, in which there was purportedly no summer, and an outbreak of the bubonic plague a year before the earthquakes began. (CbSe [Rev]: 19-20)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that before the disappearance of Set, the Clan had no hierarchy, and that there is some sentiment that the posts of the Hierophants are not in true accordance with Set's design. You know that some time in the Middle Ages, a counter-movement which protested the Hierophants emerged, known as the Decadents, and that they promoted a philosophy of wholesale corruption separate from the worship of any deity - oddly enough, you know that it is from this school of though that the modern Path of Typhoon emerged, and that many older forms of Setite worship differ in their basic philosophical outlook from modern practices. (CbSe [Rev]: 20; LS3: 96-97)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that Setites actively participated in both sides of the Crusades as spies, informants and financial backers, hopeful to profit from the deaths of faithful Christians and Muslims simultaneously. You have further heard tell that while the Followers of Set had no hand in the Children's Crusade of 1212 CE, eleven of the youths from that ill-fated expedition eventually recieved the Setite Embrace, after being sold as slaves or sacrifices to several of the Clan's temples. (CbSe [Rev]: 22-23)>

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumors linking Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II's dealings with Sultan Al-Kamil al-Malik al-Kamel Naser al-Din Abu al-Ma'ali Muhammed to have Jerusalem ceded during the Fifth Crusade to have been influenced by Setites in the region, and have heard some folk-tales regarding various sightings of Frederick after his alleged death in 1250 CE, which has been used to imply that he may have been a Setite Embrace. You further know that he was widely known for possessing distinctive red hair and green eyes "like those of a serpent." (CbSe [Rev]: 22-23)>

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Sultan Baybars is commonly held by Setites to have been slain by the Assamite Vardar Vardarian in 1277 CE, and know that many Egyptian Setites hold Vardarian in great regard, and that it is technically held by the Hierophants that the entirety of the Followers of Set owe him a Life Boon. You know that the anniversary of Baybar's death on July 1st is a Setite holiday in many regions, and that there are tales of lector-priests who have acquired his body for the purposes of publicly tormenting his soul in yearly ritual ceremonies. (CbSe [Rev]: 25)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard alternate stories regarding the Osirians, claiming that it was Horus who carried on his father's feud with Set, and that he did so through means of a strange ritual, now lost to history, which granted him an immortality different from that achieved by Set. (CbSe [Rev]: 13)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard stange tales of the magician-priests in service to other Aeons besides Osiris and Horus, and have heard legends of them in pre-Dynastic Egypt, and how they sought to bind up the world in the web of Maat, or the great Order of things, which would allow them to entrap the hearts of mankind in eternal stasis, free from ambition, anger, or hope. (CbSe [Rev]: 14)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that Setite influence was instrumental to the fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, and have heard tell of the Children of Judas, a heretical Satanist splinter group of the Decadent movement that was active in the region at the time, led by a follower of Set known as Khay'tall, who had been invited to the city by its ruler, the Toreador Michael, sometime during the fifth century. You know that the group was eventually purged. (CbSe [Rev]: 21-22)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Setites received their invitation to join the Camarilla, as they had covertly aided the Camarilla's founding elders throughout the First Anarch Revolt once the Assamites were seen to have joined the oppositon, and that Setite spies assisted in the location of Alamut whilst Setite lector-priests may have, in fact, aided the Tremere in the perfection of the curse which was laid upon the assassins. You are aware that this information is not known to the general Camarilla, although you have heard that some Setite elders still feel that the Inner Council owes the followers of Setite a collective Life Boon as a result - much as the Followers of Set owe one to Vardar Vardarian. (CbSe [Rev]: 27-29)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that the famous Italian libertine, occultist and adventurer Alessandro di Cagliostro (originally Giuseppe Balsamo) was Embraced as a Setite. Cagliostro is particularly noteworthy in that he founded a Masonic Order, known as the Egyptian Rite in 1784 CE, which paved the way for the heavy Setite influence in Freemasonry which persists to this day. (CbSe [Rev]: 30-31)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the now defunct Setite branch of the Cainite Heresy, the Church of the Black Magdelene. You know that this group claimed that Jesus had taught Mary Magdelene how he had taken away original sin through his ministry, and that any act performed out of love was holy, no matter how traditionally "sinful." You know that these Setites also believed that Christ and Magdelene had had children, who eventually became entwined with the Merovingian kings in France. You have further heard of the Path of Serpentis, a Path of Enlightenment which was practiced by the Magdelenites and which hearlds back to the teachings of a late Roman Gnostic Setite mystery cult known as the Ophites, who emphasized the role of the serpent in Eden as man's enlightener in bold defiance of the wicked God of the Old Testament. (CbSe [Rev]: 19, 26-27)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have a rough idea of the functioning and hierarchy of the Serpents of the Light. You know that the antitribu Clan as a whole is led by four Cainites known as the empereurs, and that below that the Clan is organized into cells known as shanpwel, each led by a president. You know that the group's name comes from the Milky Way, which is said to be a great shining snake encircling the universe. (CbSe [Rev]: 50)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that pressure from agressive missionaries in the Cohort of Wepwawet in the 70s and 80s is what has led to current strained relations with Damballian African Setites and the eventual ceding of the Serpents of the Light to the Sabbat. (CbSe [Rev]: 34)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Daitya in India (who probably seperated Egyptian Setites at the time of Alexander's Conquest) are a group of Brahmin Setites who identify with the legendary cosmic demons of Hindu myth, and who seek to bring about the apocalyptic purification of the world by Shiva. To do this they seek to cause as many individuals as possible to sin against their station, that the created impurity must eventually be cleansed. You know that they are led by the enigmatic elder Sundervere. (CbSe [Rev]: 33, 50-51)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Tlacique of Mesoamerica claim descendence from the dark God Tezcatlipoca, and that they ruled the mortal civilizations of the continent as Gods, demanding prayer and blood sacrifice. While the conquistadors eventually wiped out the majority of their numbers along with the native people, a few still exist today and many speculate that they are an offshoot of the Setites, given their vulnerability to light, although their use of the Discipline Protean rather than Serpentis makes some wonder. (CbSe [Rev]: 51-53)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that there are a handful of Scandanavian Setites (often mistaken for Toreador) who paid homage to the Midgard Serpent and were are heavily involved in the luxury trade. (CbSe [Rev]: 45)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Sisterhood of Sekhemet, a Setite-created feminist cult that encompasses a wide spectrum of Clans, but has in the process distanced itself from original Setite doctrine a bit. (CbSe [Rev]: 46)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know most of the major temples of the Setites by name, although you do not necessarily know much more. You are familiar with the House of the Eclipse beneath Cairo, the Red Temple of Thebes, the Garden of Asps in Mephis, the Crocodile Temple in the Faiyum, the Labyrinth on Bones in Tunis, the Descending Aerie in Tangier and the Temple of Dogs in the British Isles. (CbSe [Rev]: 17-18, 47)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that Rasputin was a Setite, although this is disputed by other Clans.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that the Setites have been credited with embracing such historical figures as: Giacomo Cassanova. You have also heard some rumors that Cleopatra and Ay (the Pharaoh following the short lived Tutankhamun's reign) were Setite ghouls, although few elders will substantiate it. (CbSe [Rev]: 16-18, 30; CbN: 31; GC3: 141)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have at least heard, in passing, of famous Setites such as: Ghede and Ezuli, who were responsible for the spread of the cult to Haiti in the 18th century; and Hesha Ruhadze,a famous Setite scholar. (CbSe [Rev]: 98-99)
