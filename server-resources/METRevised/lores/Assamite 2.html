	You know that Haqim was said to have been set up by the other Antediluvians as a judge for their unruly childer, and that Assamites strive to carry out this imperative. (CbA [Rev]: 106; PGttLC: 16)

You know that the Path of Blood emphasizes the cursed nature of vampiric existence and calls the followers of Haqim to judge and eventually execute all non-Assamite Cainites as impure. You know that it is from this path that the infamous ritual diablerie practiced by Clan Assamite descends, as it is said to bring one closer to Haqim.

	You know that the Clan is traditionally ruled by the eldest among them, and that Assamites will generally defer to the eldest of their kind in a given city (sometimes called the Castellan).
