        You have heard several theories as to why the Eldest let Gratiano destroy him, and some suspicions of your own. You might even have an inkling that Gratiano was not 100% successful.

        You have heard old legends that claim Montano coerced a Ravnos into creating an illusion of the Chi Ro over one of Constantine's battlefields, in the hopes of deliberately pushing the Roman Empire toward Christianity. (CbL: 16; LS1: 38-39)

        You have heard that the Lasombra, particularly those affiliated with the ancient goddess Ereshkigal, were at one point instrumental in the destruction of the infernal Cainites known as the Baali and the binding of their Dark Gods forever beneath the earth in one of their ancient cities. You have further heard that the powers they summoned from the Abyss to achieve this, are far beyond the kenning of any Cainite that still walks the earth. (CbBaali: 19)

        You know that the Kiasyd were first engendered when a triad of Lasombra obtained an alchemical potion which purported to be the blood of Zeernebooch (a Teutonic God of the Underworld) and mixed with it the blood of a true fae. You know that the potion, once imbibed, transformed one of them, known only as Marconius, into a strange creature, altering his physical makeup and granting him strange powers. While legend has it that Marconius was abandoned after the change, it was later found that he and his progeny later resurface around the 12th century in Strasbourg, and have had occasional relations with the Lasombra and the Sabbat every since. You further know that the Kiasyd have strange powers from the fae blood they are imbued with and possess a strange Discipline known as Mythreceria. (LS1: 28-29)
