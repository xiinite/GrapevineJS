        You have heard that in Noddist mythology, Dracian was Embraced by Irad, a member of the Second Generation, after he had attempted to burglarize the ancient's haven. You have heard that after the fall of the Second City and the destruction of the Second Generation, Caine cursed Dracian with an inability to ever achieve satisfaction, condemning him to a life of sin.

        You have heard that in some stories told by the Romani-descended Ravnos, Ravnos was the son of Tshurka, a wandering gypsy who took Caine (called Kaen in the legends) into his kumpania as an act of kindness after he had left Cainite society. Kaen later Embraced Ravnos as thankfulness for his father's kindness, after Tshurka, himself, was killed by marauding Cainites. Ravnos, in turn, Embraced much of his family at the behest of his prophetic sister Laetshi. You have also heard that in these legends, Ennoia, the daughter of Lillith, was the lover of Ravnos, and that she later betrayed him, allowing him to be killed by jealous vampires in the hopes she would be taken back into the Second City from which she had been exiled. In this story, Kaen returns after Ravnos' destruction and curses Ennoia for her treason, condemning her to live forever like a beast to atone for her bestial actions. (CbR: 14-20)

        You have heard stories that claim that the curse of the Ravnos is rooted in their founder's desire for the things he had lost in his mortal life - which compelled him to commit all manner of mortal crimes in an attempt to compensate. You have heard some variants which claim that the Antediluvian believes that the curse will grow weaker with each mortal he shares it with, which sometimes leads to the superstition that Ravnos of younger generations commit less audacious crimes than their elders. You know that this belief is similar to one held amongst Romani-descended Ravnos, which professes that Romani blood helps to keep the curse at bay, and that this leads giorgio (non-gypsy) Embraces to deadlier sins. (CbR [Rev]: 49-50)

        You have heard that in the Karavalanisha Vrana, Zapathasura was a dead man wronged by great demonic beings known as the asuratizayya. You have heard that the Gods granted this man resurrection, immortality and the power that he might pursue the asuratizayya to the ends of the Earth. You hear that they gave him the name Zapathasura, which simply means "anathema." (CbR [Rev]: 17-18; PGttLC: 51; LS4: 24)

        You know that the Path of Paradox (sometimes called the Mayaparisatya) focuses on attaining understanding of the grand illusion of life. It claims that all Kindred are locked eternally outside of the cycle of life and death (samsara) and hence must realign their purpose in life, hence the focus on the fulfilment of their jati and svadharma. You know that the cosmology of this Path is tied to the Discipline of Chimestry, and that devotees claim that this power is a means of altering the maya, or the illusionary world. You also know this Path expressly forbids the embrace of women, considering them unfit actors for the will of the divine. (CbR [Rev]: 22, 57-58; LS4: 33-34)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that Romani-descended Ravnos allegedly practice a bastardized version of the Path of Paradox, which espouses debauchery and general mayhem in contradiction to established law, and that Indian elders have, in recent nights, made attempt to revive the true Mayaparisatya among their Western brothers. (CbR [Rev]: 25; LS4: 37-38)

        You are familiar with the basic jati of the Indian Ravnos, which correspond closely to the actual Vedic caste system practiced in India. These castes are: The Brahmin, who are said to have great insight and powers of clairvoyance, and tend to be advisers and philosophers; The Kshatriyas, who are the warriors of the Clan and carry out the fight against the asuratizayya; The Vaisyas, who are embraced from the merchant classes and engage in most of the mortal interactions of the Clan; and the Chandalas, the lowest jati, who are not necessarily Ravnos, but rather a general grouping for Caitiff, non-Ravnos and Ravnos who have failed to adhere to their original jati. You also know of the Sudra, who are not a proper jati, but rather an Indian term for ghouls. (CbR [Rev]: 41-43; LS4: 27)

        You know that the Romani-descended Ravnos are sometimes known as the Phuri Dae to the Ravnos of India, and that they originally were said to have come from the Brahmin jati. Amongst the Romani-born Ravnos themselves, however, they perfere to refer to themselves as phralmulo and use the term Phuri Dae to refer only to those Ravnos of a parituclar Bloodline who are able to use the Discipline of Auspex (which is also uniquely manifested by the Indian Brahmin in place of Fortitude). These Western Ravnos also reportedly call their Indian brethren the Vritra. (CbR: 28, 33-24; LS4: 24-25)

        You know that before the Week of Nightmares struck, it was common for Western Ravnos to attempt to create a sort of family-structure through their childer (sometimes referred to as a kumpania amongst the phralmulo), and that this is often cited as the reason that the Romani-descended Ravnos were hit hardest by the Week of Nightmares, as they had a close number of Clanmates whom they felt a need to devour. (CbR [Rev]: 40, 44, 55)

        You have heard of some of the major families of nomadic phralmulo in Europe. These include the Gitano of Spain, noted for their love of song and dance and their patronage by several of the regions Toreador; the Juna of England, who claim company with the Irish Travellers or tinkers; and the German Sinti, who were allegedly a large black market force before the fall of the Berlin Wall. (CbR: 27)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that the word "Ravnos" also refers to a mortal Romani family, and know that a vast number of the pharmulo come from this lineage. You are unsure as to whether the mortal line lent it's name to the vampiric one, or the other way around. (Gypsy: 26)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with the pharmulo tradition of the kris, in which Romani-born Ravnos hold communal judgment over one another by gathering several kumpaniyi together and electing krisatora (judges) from both mortal and Ravnos stock to oversee their dispute. You know that in the event that guilt is pronounced in a kris, solakh (curses) are meted out on the accused. You are aware that many traditional pharmulo Ravnos believe in the weight of solakh, and fear them as punishment. (CbR: 38-39)

        You know that a massive disturbance took place in Bangledesh during the Week of Nightmates, and that 1.3 million people died as a result of what was deemed by the media to have been a massive typhoon. You have heard theorists state that this "storm" was, in fact, the rising of the Ravnos Antediluvian. (ToTB: 123, 125)

        You have heard of legendary Ravnos such as: Durga Syn, an ancient Methuselah who has an ongoing feud with the Nosferatu Baba Yaga, and whose brood was one of the few notable European groups to survive the Week of Nightmares. (CbR: 28; CbR [Rev]: 99; CotI: 52-57)
