        You've heard that some of the Old Clan believe Vicissitude to be a disease, inflicted by terrible creatures known as Soul Eaters. You may wonder if this has anything to do about the legends of Tzimisce's flesh being in each of his childer.

        You know that the Children of Dracon regard Kupala as a curse upon the Clan and this is why they forfeit any koldunic knowledge. You hear that they also believe that Tzimisce was killed during the Salubri wars, but it was the Dracon who managed to use his embryotic remains to breed another incarnation. This lends some credence, if true, to the theories that the eldest survived Lugoj's diablerie.

        You've heard that Lambach Ruthven indicates that Tzimisce somehow transferred it's consciousness either to Lugoj to into the Cathedral of Flesh or in some cases to both. You know that several members of the Clan, taking stock in Rutheven's words, suspect that the Antediluvian isn't dead.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard stories that further imply that Kupala's fire flower, was in fact an extension of the Antediluvian himself, and that the Vaulderie only serves to help place even more under Tzimisce's sway.
