        You have heard of some of the rarer "breeds" of the Nosferatu.

You have also heard of the Volsi, a bog-dwelling group native to the area of the Rhine, who were reportedly of a grotesque size and cannibalistic temperament. You have heard that rumors abound that the Tzimisce may have had a hand in "furthering the development" of these strange Kindred. (LS4: 59-61)
