        You've heard stories about the details of Cappadocius' diablerie, and you have further heard of Cappadocius' two councillors Japheth and Constancia, who tried in vain to convince him not to Embrace Augustus in the first place. You have further heard that there might have been intervention from other Clans which led to the downfall of the Cappadocians. (CbC: 20-22; CbGi [Rev]: 20, 22; GC1: 8)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of the insane Cappadocian ambition toward godhood, and of the idea that Capaddocius somehow sought to "diablerize" God, due to a series of bizarre Gnostic beliefs that he held. You know that Ambrogiono Giovanni is infamous for looking into how precisely Cappadocius intended on doing this. (CbGi [Rev]: 20-21; GC2: 101)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard variant stories from where the "Curse of the Lamia" originated, and have heard the idea tossed around that it might have come from Japheth instead of Lamia. (CbC: 20-22; CbGi: 14)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of the really minor families absorbed into the Giovanni by marriage. These include the the Beryn, who are Flemish traders with inroads to Africa; the Hidalgo, a Mexican bloodline, supposedly wiped out by the Sabbat; the Koenig, who are German death cultists; the Li Weng, who are Chinese geomancers based outside of San Fransisco; the Rothsteins, who are Jewish-American Kabbalists centered around Vegas; and the St. Johns, who are English Freemasons. (CbGi [Rev]: 33)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know a little of the Harbingers of Skulls, a strange bloodline, seemingly of Cappadocian descent, who are all blighted with a skeletal appearance. You know they bear some sort of grudge against Clan Giovanni as a whole and that they have recently allied themselves with the Sabbat, particularly in South America. (CbGi: 65; CbGi [Rev]: 25)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard rumors that Potchli, the founder of the Pisanob line, is not Giovanni by Embrace, but may, in fact, be a member of an earlier Cappadocian bloodline. You know that no Giovanni claims responsibility for Potchli's Embrace, and that Potchli has an eerie corpse-like quality to him, similar to the Cappadocian Clan's curse. You also have heard stories of Cainite presences amongst the Aztec Empire prior to European expansion, and know that the God Huitzilopochtli is rumored to have been a vampire masquerading as a God ...and possibly Pochtli's Sire. (CbGi [Rev]: 31)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard tell of how the Rosselini were co-opted into the Giovanni. Apparently, Augustus, in a show of power, rent the very souls from the most prominent members of the Rosselini family and then refused to return them until they swore fealty to him. (CbGi: 34; CbGi [Rev]: 32-33)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Endless Night ritual will require 100,000,000 souls to complete, and that some overzealous elders have made plans to create large scale disasters or global conflicts to help fill out this number. You know of Valentina della Passaglia, a wraith formerly of Giovanni blood who warned her relatives that the Endless Night Ritual will ensure their destruction, given the number of hostile ghosts who await them on the other side. You know that those who take her warnings seriously are refered to as Valentinists, and that they are universally loathed in the Clan. (CbGi [Rev]: 40-41, 52)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Samedi have had dealings with the Giovanni in the past, although you hear that the Baron Samedi (progeintor of the Samedi bloodline) and Augustus hate one another vehemently. You further know that there have been rumors linking the Baron back to the Capuchin. (CbGi: 19-21)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumors that the Nagaraja are not fully gone, at aleast according to a few della Passaglia in Korea. (CbGi [Rev]: 45)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Ventrue Jadviga Almanov of Bohemia and her Clan directly supported the nascent Giovanni in their attempts to usurp Cappadocian power, aiding Claudius Giovanni in an early attempt to overthrow Japheth. You know that it was under the cover of such support that Augustus perpetrated the diablerie of Cappadocius. You further know that Almanov was apparently joined by a multitude of other supporters from various interested Clans who met in covert on April 4th, 1444 AD, and that this group was known at the Conspiracy of Isaac. (GC1: 17-49)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of the True Vessel, a cup in which Japheth sealed a few drops of Cappadocius' blood before passing it to the Giovanni for the Embrace. You know that Augustus fervently seeks this artifact, and that he slew his childe Claudius Giovanni when he destroyed the Erciyes library where it was rumored to have been hidden. You further have heard tell that the Capuchin was much involved in bringing the True Vessel to Giovanni attention in the first place, and that he somehow came to possess the remains of Claudius Giovanni after his demise. (CbC: 20-22; CbGi: 17-18; CbGi [Rev]: 23, 27)

        You've heard of some of the fairly obscure Giovanni of note, such as: Paolo Sardenzo, a failed innovator who attempted to use the events of World War I to complete the Endless Night; and Marianna, one of the rare Giovanni Embraced outside of the mortal Giovanni family, who has dedicated herself to thwarting the efforts of the Clan. (CbGi [Rev]: 97-98; GC1-GC4)
