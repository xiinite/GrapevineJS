<h3>Lore: Caitiff x3</h3>

        You are somewhat familiar with the incriminating passages in the Book of Nod. They read: "And you will know these last times by the time of thin blood/which will mark vampires that cannot beget/You will know them by the clanless/who will come to rule." (You do not necessarily have a good understanding of the context of these passages and may require Lore: Noddist to known more.)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that increasing Noddist sentiment in the Camarilla has led to the increase in Scourges, out of fear of the aforementioned prophecy.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that very "Thin-Blooded" Clanless vampires have occasionally been able to have mortal children, although this is very very rare, and has only occurred in recent years. These offspring of the damned have been called Dhampirs, after their equivalent in Eastern European folklore.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumor that some "Thin-Blooded" vampires have been reported to possess strange powers not known to most Clans, and that many report a strange sort of Clairvoyance regarding future events.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the movement known as "The Unbound", a collective of Caitff Anarchs who claim that other vampires differentiation into Clans is a self-impoised limitation. You know that they claim that Caine himself was technically a Caitff and take pride in their condition.
