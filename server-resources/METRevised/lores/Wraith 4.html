        You have heard that Stygia and the Hierarchy are merely the powers that govern the Western lands of the dead (referred to as the Dark Kingdom of Iron) - and have heard rumors that other cultures possess different forms of rulership.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Labyrinth - a hive of spectres that lies beneath Stygia, and no doubt heard horrible horrible loathsome bad stories about it. You know that it is in this metaphysical nightmare landscape that Harrowings allegedly take place, and that Oblivion (rather than being a simple abstract concept) is said to lie directly beneath the Labyrinth. You also know that all spectres are connected to some sort of hive-mind and serve Oblivion in startling unity.

        You know that Charon no longer rules Stygia (having disappeared in the early 20th century), and that the closest thing to a government that the Hierarchy still possesses are the Deathlords who head the various legions. You know a little more about the legions now, and know that each one of them is comprised of wraiths who died deaths by a similar cause (war, disease, suicide etc..).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of the Ferrymen, an organization separate from the Hierarchy that Charon allegedly founded. You know that they provide some of the safest passage across the Tempest, and that they are said to be very powerful.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of Far Shores - islands within the Tempest where heretic cults set up shop, and where one can allegedly find all manner of heavens and hells waiting for those who seek them.

        You know that the Guilds were declared illegal in times past, but that a handful still survive to this day. You have heard of most of the more prominent guilds which still publicaly remain in Stygia, even if their legality is occasionally questioned. These include the Artificers (masters of Inhabit and the art of soulforging), the Chanteurs (masters of the arts of Keening), the Harbingers (masters of the arts of Argos), the Masquers (masters of the art of Moliation), the Oracles (masters of the art of Fatalism), the Pardoners (masters of the art of Castigation), the Sandmen (masters of the art of Phantasm), and the Usurers (masters of the art Usury). You know that most of the Guilds specializing in Arcanoi that break the Dictum Mortuum (i.e. Arcanoi you are likely to encounter) have either been disbanded permanently or gone deep underground.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the primary reason for friction between the Hierarchy and the Heretics is that the Hierarchy has formally disavowed the concept of Transcendence (a state reached when a wraith fulfills whatever it remained behind to do and "passes on"), and as such

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with most of the legal Arcanoi. In addition to what you knew about before, you now know of the following: Castigate (the ability to confront and tame the dark Shadow personality of another wratih), Fatalism (The ability to foretell the future and find patterns in current events), Lifeweb (The ability to find and manipulate the connections between a wraith and it's fetters), and Usury (The ability to exchange Pathos or Plasm between wraiths). You have also heard that spectres possess their own dark arts different from normal wraiths and that there are some obscure Arcanoi that are forbidden by Stygian law.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumors of wraiths so driven to fulfill their goals that they manage to retake a hold of their dead bodies and claw their way back into the land of the living. You know that such things, if they exist, are no doubt rare, and possibly dangerous to cross.
