        You have a basic, if somewhat stereotyped, idea of what each of the Clans are like and know about the existence of one or two of the major Bloodlines. You can recognize all of the traditional Clan Symbols. (LotN [Rev]: 30-55; VtM [Rev]: 45-48, 68-91)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with the general effects of the eight basic Disciplines (Auspex, Animalism, Dominate, Celerity, Fortitude, Obfuscate, Potence, Presence) (LotN [Rev]: 132-189)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the act of diablerie can allow the diablerist to unnaturally lower their generation, and occasionally steal the powers, abilities and aptitudes of the victim through the act of drinking their soul. You know that this process isn't 100% clean, and that as a result, a diablerist may start to exhibit personality quirks and characteristics of their victim. (LotN [Rev]: 215-216; VtM [Rev]: 224-220)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that a vampire who enters wassail becomes a creature known as a Wight, a mostly mindless remnant of an individual who is driven entirely by the desire to feed and kill. You know that Wights are short-lived, but that they can be extremely dangerous and exhibit a great deal of cunning. (VtM [Rev]:)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know specifically that a blood bond is formed through drinking a Cainite's blood on three separate nights, with each drink causing an increasing level of affection. You know that it takes one year and one day for each "level" of the bond to dissipate. You further know that if a thrall should through their own willful action kill the one who holds them bound, the bond is said to dissapate immediately. (LotN [Rev]: 211-212; VtM [Rev]: 12, 219-220)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that many elder vampires enter torpor and remain inert for long periods of time. You know that involuntary torpor seems to last longer for vampires of a more inhumane or monstrous streak. You further know that all vampires left staked for appropriate periods of time will eventually enter a starvation torpor as they run out of blood to keep themselves conscious - and that such specimens will eventually mummify and wither as their body tries to consume itself for nourishment. You have heard that this process is excruciatingly painful (LotN [Rev]: 199; VtM [Rev]: 224)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Book of Nod, an ancient chronicle supposedly telling the story of Caine's exile in the land of Nod and containing much of the founding mythology of vampire-kind. (VtM [Rev]: 53)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the First City, known sometimes as Enoch, where Caine and his legendary childer first settled, and you have heard of the Second City, which was built after the First City was destroyed in the biblical deluge. You have also, even if you are not a Brujah, heard tell of Carthage (occasionally called the Third City), which was apparently a great Cainite stronghold of some sort before it's destruction in the Punic Wars. (VtM [Rev]: 53-55)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that the Antediluvians diablerized their progenitors (the Second Generation) and received their respective curses from Caine as a result, even if you aren't sure of what all those curses are. (VtM [Rev]: 53-55)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that there is a myth that the endtimes will come for all vampires when the Antediluvians reawaken, and that this event shall be known as Gehenna. (VtM [Rev]: 58)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the First Anarch Revolt, an uprising during the dark ages during which the younger underclass of vampires rose up and tried to overthrow their elders. You know that both the Sabbat and Camarilla formed as a result of this. (VtM [Rev]: 44, 65)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware of alternate and alien moralities known as the Paths of Enlightment, which some few Cainites adhere to in place of human values in an attempt to keep the Beast at bay. You know that such Paths are said to take centuries to master and fully acclimate oneself to, and that followers of Paths are almost unheard of within the Camarilla. (VtM [Rev]: 286-295)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of some desperate few campires that have thrown in their lot with infernal forces and demonic entities, and know more than enough to know that nothing good can come from this. (LotN [Rev]: 210; VtM [Rev]: 230-231)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumors of a mythical state known as Golconda in which a vampire can find peace with his Beast and attain a respite from the damnation of his or her existence. You know that this state is almost universally regarded as a fairy-tale. (LotN [Rev]: 210; VtM [Rev]: 230-231)
