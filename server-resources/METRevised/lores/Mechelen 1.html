        Bus Station
        Description: The smell of stale diesel fumes is omnipresent, along with that
        of festering garbage from overflowing trashcans. There is a distinct undercurrent of the pungent odor of human sweat and urine. The ground is littered with broken glass, cigarette butts, syringes and other detritus. Expansive concrete shelters, almost completely covered in graffiti, provide deep shadows in which the homeless sleep, while the occasional addict shoots up, or a prostitute services a john. Buses, however, are nowhere in sight at this late hour. The station is a plaza, at the hub of all of the city’s bus routes, an area populated at night largely by the criminally desperate. The whole neighborhood is covered in flyers, but the majority of them are weeks or months out of date, while most of the locals are willfully oblivious to nearly everything, keeping their eyes down to avoid inviting contact with strangers.
        Folks assume that everyone from this area is a pimp, crack whore or homeless lunatic who’d step over a dying man before offering to help him. For the most part, they’re right.

        Haven Qualities: There’s plenty of feeding to be had, but precious little
        secure space.

        Cathedral
        Description: A fine example of French gothic architecture, the cathedral fairly towers over all other buildings in the area.
        Within, stained glass windows depict images of saints and angels. Dozens of tiny flames in the racks of votive candles flicker as air moves through the building. A young janitor is dusting around the altar, and takes care to genuflect briefly, crossing himself, as he moves from one side of the slightly raised dais to the other.

        While easily reached, the cathedral’s neighborhood isn’t exactly the best place to wander, anymore. The cathedral’s records are extensive, but there’s no security system here, and the building’s layout isn’t the best for unimpeded visibility. The area has been going downhill for years, now.

        Haven Qualities: Feeding can be had in the immediate area, and a Kindred with the right connections could manage to secure a haven in one of the many buildings in the area owned by the Catholic Church.

        City Courts
        Description: This beige marble structure vaguely evokes a sense of Classical architecture, married to early 20th-century aesthetics. One of the two  lamps standing watch over the stairway leading into the court is burnt out, and only half of the other streetlights are in working order. Within, the beige gives way to ivory white marble, accented by Art Deco sensibilities. A clerk of the court wanders by, rather unsubtly straightening her skirt as she quietly speaks into a digital recorder.

        Public transportation makes frequent stops around the plaza on which the court, the center of the city’s law, is located.
        There is very little that can’t been researched, seen or otherwise known here. Newspapers are plentiful. Conversations and crowded hallways make eavesdropping surprisingly easy. But people are always on the lookout here, whether security guards watching for trouble, overwhelmed visitors trying to find traffic court or career-minded young lawyers looking for their big break.

        Haven Qualities: Hunting is difficult here at night (everything closes down around 6 P.M.), housing is generally of modest size, considering its exorbitant price, and the area is remarkably secure.

        City Hall
        Description: A broad, twostory gothic  gray structure built on a low rise, this City
        Hall building appears to have been built sometime within the 18th century or so.
        What can be glimpsed through the locked double doors of the décor is modern and tasteful. City Hall sits at the intersections
        of some of the busiest streets in town. Bus stops and cab stands are all over the area. The sidewalks here are actually meant to be walked on. City Hall has a great many informational resources at its disposal, as well as vigilant security. The neighborhood
        in which City Hall is located is decent, though there is little real sense of community here.

        Haven Qualities: Goodsized and secure havens are available to those vampires who don’t mind ranging a bit for their sustenance. Buildings in the area include lots of turn-of-the-century rehabs with forgotten rooms, abandoned floors and isolated sub-basements. Modern office technology and budget cuts have left many office buildings half-empty in the area.

        Police Department
        Description: This building has seen better days. The brick façade is old and in need of repair in a few places, while one broken window on the second floor is covered over with clear plastic sheeting and duct tape. Inside, sepia-tone marble and pale wood paneling serve to give the whole place an appearance of faded dignity.
        Most of the amenities look as though they haven’t been updated or adequately maintained for 30 or so years. Police shuffle along, halfway oblivious, performing their nightly routines.

        The station is on a side street, in a slightly out-of-the-way location, but a bus passes right by it and it’s not particularly hard to find. The computer systems aren’t cutting-edge anymore, but there is a tremendous volume of information stored here, on various media, and, while the police are collectively apathetic, someone is likely to notice if anything is out of sorts here.

        Slums
        Description: Tall, old apartment buildings close in on all sides in this claustrophobic neighborhood. Even the narrow streets feel like alleys. Networks of fire escapes obscure the night sky, and there is a persistent smell of waste and old trash coming from between and behind the buildings, and from the backed-up sewer system. People tend to hustle past, keeping their eyes averted from strangers, and no one’s voice climbs above a whisper in the streets.

        It’s hard to navigate the slums, which are perilous for even the most stalwart. The populace here is kept ignorant and unaware through fear of violence. People here are assumed to be either the perennially downtrodden or else deplorable sorts of criminals, and that assessment is largely a reasonable one.

        Haven Qualities: It’s easy enough to take over an abandoned tenement here and to feed freely on the locals, but there’s little in the way of security to be had.

        The Centre
        Description: Most of these duplex homes are badly in need of a new paintjob. Eaves sag under the weight of years and weather damage. The people, too, seem to sag under a heavy burden. Hardly anyone takes notice of a man inflicting a savage beating on a woman attired as a low-rent prostitute, and no one moves to stop him. A small-time drug dealer openly hawks his wares on a corner.

        This centre is very much unsafe. While one can hear the talk on the street here, much goes on that is obscured from sight.
        This centre is just a bad place to live.
