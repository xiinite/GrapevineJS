<h3>Lore: Camarilla x3</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are cognizant of the details regarding the formation of the Sabbat and Camarilla, and have read the Treaty of Thorns, a document dating back to 1493, when the founding members of the Sect met near the village of Thorns with Anarch officials to officially end the Anarch Revolt. You hear that the Camarilla's formation was sparked by the attempted assassination of Hardestadt by a Brujah Anarch named Tyler, and you further know that the Camarilla was formed by the elders not only to provide a haven from the fires of the Inquisition but also in the hopes of subduing the rebellious Anarchs. (GC1: 12)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You can name all of the original founding members of the Camarilla who were present for the formal formation of the Sect in 1450, and who comprised the original Inner Council. They are: Adana de Sforza (Brujah), Milov Petrenkov (Gangrel), Camilla Banes (Malkavian), Josef von Bauren (Nosferatu), Rafeal de Corzon (Toreador), Mistress Fanchon (Tremere) and Hardestadt himself (Ventrue). You have no idea if any of them still remain alive, awake and in power. (GC1: 51-61)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Traditions (save the Masquerade) may, in fact, vary greatly in their application based on the whims of a particular Prince, although the Inner Circle and Justicariate always have final say.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the position of Prince was in fact a carry over from earlier times in which the eldest vampire would have a sort of de facto rule over a Domain, and that the post was formally ratified to be what it is today after an Anarch committed a gross breach of the the Masquerade in 1743, pampleteering publically against elder Kindred society. (The Anarch was naturally killed.) (VtM [Rev]: 35)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Primogen Council was based upon the Primogeniture Assembly established by Prince Jürgen of Magdeburg in the Dark Ages. You know that the role of Primogen within a Court can vary vastly from Domain to Domain, and that some Primogen Councils may rival the local Prince in power.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know all of the positions held in relation to Primogen and their Councils. These include: the Myrmidons, who acts a a Prmogen's personal bodyguard (You're aware that Myrmidon is an archaic word for Archon in some circles); the Scribe, who acts a Primogen's personal secretary; and the Steward, who tends to the meeting place of the assembled Primogen.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know the names of all of the founding members of the Camarilla who met at Thorns, as well as a few glimpses of their personal history.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware of and have read (if applicable) the Treaty of Tyre made with Clan Assamite and the Promise of 1528 made with Clan Giovanni. You are also aware that an initial offer was extended to Clan Setite to join the Camarilla but it was declined. (CbSe [Rev]: 27-28)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the nascent Camarilla was nearly destroyed in 1595, when Toreador Justicar Jean-Paul Pierre LaMont turned traitor and allied with the Sabbat. Apparently a covert attack was planned for a meeting of the Inner Council based on LaMont's information, although it was averted at the last second.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that all Justicars must submit to an oath of station before appointment.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have a fair idea of how each Justicar stands politically. You know that Streck and Paschek tend to be fairly conservative; that Guil is often considered unnecessarily inhumane (even though she is the only Justicar to remain from the previous election) and that Di Zagreb was widely considered a compromise choice, and wields significantly less power within the Justicariate.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard political rumblings relating to the idea of appointing a seventh Justicar. You know that there is a heavily idealistic but very small bloc backing the assignment of a Justicar ex Miscellanea, who would tend to "minority" Clans, such as defected Setites, Samedi, Lasombra, Caitiff and such. You are also aware that the small defection of Schismatic Camarilla Assamites may have the clout to swing an Assamite Justicar.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of a few of the more famous public Archons by name. These include: Theo Bell (Brujah Archon to Justicar Paschek, leader of the assault on New York in 1999), Vidal Jarbeaux (Toreador Archon to Justicar Guil) and Ferderico DiPadua (Nosferatu, prevented the assult led by LaMont in 1595).
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You're familiar with the entire current listing of Anethema and, have heard that the Camarilla employs a secret group of Archons known as the Alastors to hunt them down. You know that this group was apparently founded in part by Justicar Lucinde.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of a few other Archon groups in addition to the Alastors. You are aware of the informal "Dogcatchers" who specialize in Lupine surveillance and control, the E Division, which looks into paranormal and as of yet unexplained supernatural phenomena, the Josians, who are tasked with infiltrating and rooting out Gehenna cults, and the Quaesitors, a Tremere-only group of blood magic specialists.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know the various types of conclaves that are often called, and are aware that Princes and elders may be tried for crimes at some, although these are normally small affairs. (VtM [Rev]: 66)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have at least heard, in passing, of famous Camarilla Vampires, such as: Karsh, the Gangrel "warlord" of the Camarilla and arch-rival to Xaviar; Queen Anne Bowsley of London, Prince of one of the bulwark Domains of the Sect, who managed to oust her also famous predecessor, Mithras; and Carlak, Prince of Prague, and a former candidate for Brujah Justicar.
