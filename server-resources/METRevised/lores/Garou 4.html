        You know that most Disciplines affecting a human will not effect a lycanthrope in wolf form, but that Animalism is said to have some effects.

    You know that werewolves fall deeper into their curse through giving into their bestial nature, committing atrocity, and/or eating the flesh of men. This has the result of both making the wolf more powerful, strong and capable of killing, while simultaneously also making them more feral, uncontrolled and quick to anger. You have heard that some of the most powerful werewolves were comparable to the oldest of elder vampires in the depth of their prowess - however, you know that werewolves tell unsettling stories, of how such creatures died - not by being killed - but by rapidly starving to death as they ran out of prey to feed of off. You've heard stories that Bête du Gévaudan was allegedly a lycanthrope who had fallen into such a state.

        You know that the original progeniters of the werewolf curse were neither bite victims, nor werewolves by birth, but were rumored to be men so wicked that they received a curse from God that their bodies should come to resemble their souls and appetites.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the catalyst for transformation to a werewolf after being bitten (or even being born into the curse) is almost always the act of murder in hot blood, and that virtually every werewolf alive killed somebody the first time they transformed.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumors that there is a way for a willing mortal to transform themselves into a werewolf via some form of ritual.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the alpha of a pack is a werewolf born into the curse, and that his pack generally consists of those he has brought into the curse through biting. You further know that because the curse of any "beta" belongs originally to the blood of the alpha, that as such betas show a supernatural psychological submission to their alpha. It is excruciatingly hard for them to act directly against him.
