    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Order of St. Blaise, a group which originated in the Dark Ages in humrous reaction to Saint veneration (St. Blaise was the Saint who protected one agianst maladies or attacks to the throat). The group now operates to extend Sabbat influence within the Catholic Church.

        You have heard a few rumors regarding Sabbat specific Bloodlines, although you haven't heard much.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that the Tzimisce are said to have bred their ghouled serfs into bloodlines known as Revanants, mortals who show the aspects of ghouldom at birth and without ingesting vampiric blood.

        You are familiar (in basic theory) with some of the Paths of Enlightment specific to the two ruling Clans of the Sect. These are the Path of Metamophosis, the Tzimisce Path focusing on transhumanist sentiments and bodily experimentation; and the Path of Night, the signature Path of Clan Lasombra which calls for Cainites to act as pre-ordained agents of evil. You have also heard of the Path of Redemption, which exhorts Cainites to attempt to redeem themselves in the eyes of a Christian God and which is practiced almost exclusively by the agents of the Inquisition. (LotN [Rev]: 76-77; CtB: 65-74, 86-90; VtM [Rev]: 291-293)

        You have at least heard, in passing, of famous Sabbat vampires such as: Sasha Vykos, a famous Tzimisce Priscus known for his/her/its androgyny; and Vasantasena, the Malkavian antitribu who turned to the Sabbat immediatedly after the Convention of Thorns, claiming she had prophetic visions of Gehenna.
