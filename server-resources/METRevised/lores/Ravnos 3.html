        You have heard that in Noddist mythology, Dracian was set up of as one of the spies of Irad, who suspected a conspiracy amongst the Antediluvians. Dracian later turned against him and joined the other conspirators. According to this mythos, Ennoia was said to have blamed Dracian for tempting her into the war upon the Second Generation. (CbR [Rev]: 20)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard some unique Romani stories also dealing with a character called Dracian, which claim that he was, among other things, the husband of Daenna, the grandmother of all gypsies. In these stories, Dracian is always slain by an elder vampire named Amriat, leaving his widow alone to tend to her people. (Gypsy: 12-19)

        You have that, similar to the Romani legend in which Christ forgives the sins of all gypsies after one of them attempts to steal the nails for his cross, some elder pharmulo believe that Kaen forgave the Ravnos of all of their crimes for the aid they offered him when he was a wanderer. (CbR: 34)

        You know that in the Middle Ages, some people spread about the folk tale that the first Ravnos was, in fact, Judas, who had been condemned to eternal wandering and desire to sin for his crime of betraying Christ. (PGttLC: 52)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have at some point read a copy of the Karavalanisha Vrana. You are very cognizant of the fact that it refers to deities that did not come into existence until 4,000 years after it was alleged to be written, and that it is probably the work of a collection of Ravnos and not the writing of Zapathasura alone, as is claimed. You also are aware that the epic has no ending, and have heard rumors that the poems finale lies with Zapathasura himself. You have heard that several Vritra Ravnos hunted for it with no success. (CbR [Rev]: 24; PGttLC: 55-56)

        You are familiar with the four ages of Brahma in Vedic tradition, as they often apply to the epics of the Vritra. You know that the world's cycle is traditionally divided into the Satya Yuga (Age of Gold), which was allegedly a time of paradise and purity; the Treta Yuga (Age of Gold), in which evil first entered the world; the Dvapara Yuga (Age of Bronze), in which demons manage to corrupt mankind's protectors; and the Kali Yuga (Age of Iron) which is the fallen age in which we currently dwell. (PGttLC: 50; LS4: 24)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard according to the Karavalanisha Vrana that the Gods both blessed and cursed Zapathasura after he was resurrected. It is said that Kali, goddess of war and bloodshed, gave him a thirst for vengeance; that Varuna, God of Strength, gave him potency of his blood; that Indra, the god of storms and crops, gave him the gift of fertility, that he might make other men to fight for him; that Hanuman, the monkey king, gave him the power to speak to animals; that Devi, the core form of femininity, gave him power over the maya; and that Himuvaat, god of moutains, gave him the durability of stone. You know it is said that other gods refused to bless him, saying he was an unclean and polluted thing - being dead. These were Surya, the God of the Sun; Agni, the God of fire; and Brahma, the God of Creation - who respectively left him vulnerable to fire and sunlight, sterile and starving. (CbR [Rev]: 18; PGttLC: 51; LS4: 24)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard according to the Karavalanisha Vrana, the asuratizayya were once known as the siddhi, beings who were charged with tending to and protecting humanity. According to the epic, they eventually made bargains with the true demons, and were cast into their fallen state as punishment, which in turn helped to usher in the Dvpara Yuga. You are aware, at this point, that these myths seem to correspond with those of the Cathayans. (CbR [Rev]: 17-18; PGttLC: 50; LS4: 24)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that the Ravnos who ruled over the city of Harrapa were involved in a prolonged and violent open conflict with asuratizayya dwelling the settlement of Mohenjo-Daro, and that some scholars suspect that early Vedic myths regarding the battles of the gods and demons are references to this war. (CbR: 21; CbR [Rev]: 20-21)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that according to certain Vritra texts, Ennoia, like Zapathasura, was once charged with combating the asuratizayya, but was cursed by the gods for rejecting her duties after learning the price of her power. As a result of this treason, Gangrel are thought to be cursed by the Gods to live amongst beasts, and to be forever barred from fulfilling their proper destiny. You hear that some believe that it is possible for Gangrel who practice the Mayaparisatya to reclaim their lost svadharma, and that this belief is known as "The Gangrel Heresy" among adherents of the Path. (CbR [Rev]: 19-20; LS4: 28-29)

        You are familiar with the five legendary childer of Zapathasura, and know that three of the major Indian Ravnos jati are said to be descended from them. These five Methuselahs are: The Black Mother (from which the Brahmin jati descends), an old crone associated with the cult of Kali Ma; Rakashasa, a notorious deceiver, who is said to have walked freely among the asuratizayya and to have betrayed Zapathasura grievously; Chandraputra (from whom the Kshatriya jati descends), a great warrior-king who is said to have ruled over Harrapa; Ravana, of which little is known save that he allegedly made pacts with true demons; and Ramessu (from which the Vaisya jati descends), who kept company with mortals and watched for the influence of the asuratizayya upon them. (CbR [Rev]: 18-19; LS4: 25)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard legends of the gradual abandonment of Zapathasura by all of his childer save Chandraputra, and have heard this referred to as the Ravnos Diaspora. According to legends, Ramessu was the first to vanish, without seeming explanation. This was followed by Rakshasa committing his betrayal, battling Zapathasura and then fleeing in disgrace to the region of either China or Africa. After this, the Black Mother was said to have uncovered Ravana's ties to the infernal, after which he too departed. The Black Mother herself is said to have left after the attempted invasion of the region by Alexander the Great, following his armies back toward the West. You know that at this time many younger Ravnos and Ravnos-Embraced Chandalas also fled India, traveling both East and West of India as they attempted to escape the endless conflict with the asuratizayya. (CbR [Rev]: 22, 25)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that it was Chandraputra who founded the Mayaparisatya, in an attempt to re-stabilize those Vritra who remained in India after the Diaspora. (CbR [Rev]: 22)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that some zealous Vritra practice Sabbat-style mass Embraces in an attempt to furnish large groups of shock troops to combat the asuratizayya. (CbR [Rev]: 40)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Alexandrite Ravnos, who were initially native to Egypt, and were noted as being extraordinarily formal in matters of Cainite etiquette. You know that some Ravnos from the region were said to claim Akhenaten as their progenitor, claiming that he was cursed for his hubris of abandoning all Gods save the sun by being doomed to never see daylight. (CbR [Rev]: 23-24; PGttLC: 52; LS4: 22-23)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Bashirite Ravnos, a Christian doomsday cult who attempted to mix the doctrine of the bastardized Western Path of Paradox with certain interpretations of the Revelation of St. John. You know that Bashirites believed that it was their duty to bring about the coming of the scriptural apocalypse, and that they would often attack pilgrims and devout Christians, Jews and Muslims in an attempt to hasten the end times. You have also heard that its founder, Bashir of Damascus, claimed to have had personal contact with Christ and to have achieved absolution for his sins. (CbR [Rev]: 25; PGttLC: 53-54; LS4: 13)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Sybarite Ravnos, who allegedly founded the false Path of Paradox practiced by so many Western Ravnos today (leading it to sometimes be referred to as the Roman Path of Paradox). You know that the Sybarites were renowned as debauched pirates, brigands and slavers, and that they were present in European history from the time of the Roman Empire onward. You have also heard that it was common Sybarite practice to steal titles and to claim association or lineage with distant nobles or Ravnos elders, which often causes the group's genealogy to be hard to trace. You have heard that the Sybarites claimed that their founder was any number of personalities, ranging from Julius Caesar to a close associate of Emperor Caligula to Romulus himself. (CbR: 41; CbR [Rev]: 24; PGttLC: 53)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Phaedymite Ravnos, a small group of honor-bound Cainites from the region of Gaul who served as couriers during the Midde Ages. They were apparently named for their matriarch, Phaedyme, who was alleged to have disguised herself as a man to join Alexander the Great's expeditions. You know that the Phaedymites interactions with the Sybarites occasionally engendered violence. (CbR [Rev]: 24-25; PGttLC: 54-55; LS4: 14)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that the term Phuri Dae, in addition to being a catch-all name that the Vritra give to the phralmulo and a specific term for a Bloodline of seers, also refers to a mortal lineage of Romani who are often associated with folk-magic and the "Sight." You can guess that the Phuri Dae Ravnos probably originally had ties to this family. (Gypsy: 26-28)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware of a handful of Ravnos known as the Kalderash who have established themselves in China and East Asia as traders, and whom apparently are able to either hide from or to coexist with the asuratizayya. (CbR: 32; CbR [Rev]: 45-46)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Wuzho, fanatical Ravnos descended from the Romani bloodline known as the Tsurara (or Knife Tribe), who have vowed to eradicate all of the non-Ravnos undead from the Earth in protection of their Clan. You know that in times past, the Wuzho were given wide birth, as bloodhunts on Ravnos followed shortly after their arrival in a city. (CbR: 32, 34)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the saddhus, a scant few Ravnos antitribu and elder Brahmin Vritra who serve as teachers for the Mayaparisatya in it's wholly uncorrupted form. You hear that they are capable of performing great acts of blood sorcery known as Sadhana and that they are to be respected and feared. (CtB: 81)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard a legend that Zapathasura Embraced a woman once out of love, and that the restriction in Mayaparisatya regarding the Embrace of women was imposed selfishly so that none should every be the rival of Zapathasura's paramour. Another story claims that Zapathasura's sister so disgraced herself in some manner that women were no longer considered a fit sacrifice for the gods, meaning that they could not recieve the Embrace. (LS4: 26)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that the Ravnos have been credited with embracing such historical figures as Mata Hari (although this is disputed by the Assamites). (CbR [Rev]: 99-100)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that Durga Syn was originally offered the Embrace several time by Baba Yaga, and that her continued refusal to accept drove the Hag to curse her body - leaving her an ugly withered crone. (CbR [Rev]: 99)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that many Ravnos who survived the Week of Nightmares claimed to have had visions of a dragon, a tiger and/or a bird and of a ten-headed creature devouring its own heads (which is consistent with the classical Indian depiction of Ravana the Demon King, a figure not-necessary related to the Methusaleh, in spite of his shared name). You have heard that other Cainites with powers of foresight and even mortals with reported oracular ability echoed these vision. (ToTB: 126)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of legendary Ravnos such as: Ettiene de Fauberge, the former Prince of Acre; Harasvarupa Nishiitharudhira Amavarati, a Vritra elder who is spear-heading conversion to the Mayaparisatya in Europe; Marcia Felica Licina, a noted historian of the Clan, and childe of Phaedyme who compiled several important journals regarding Ravnos history; Alexis Sorkorin, an infamous thief and burgler who has mae the Camarilla's Red List; and Ivan Krenyenko, a notorious black market operator who is simultaneously hunted by the Sabbat, Camarilla, Society of Leopold and the KGB due to his exploits. (CbR: 65, CtB: 80; KmW: 57-61; LS4: 11, 18)
