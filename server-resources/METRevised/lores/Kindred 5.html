<h3>Lore: Kindred x5</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of every major Clan and Bloodline.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know about the different intra-clan divisions, such as the Assamite castes, City and Country Gangrel, and the Dementation/Dominate split between Malkavians, (although you may need Clan-specific Lores for more details.)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware of the diableries of Cappadocious and Saulot by the Giovanni and the Tremere respectively, and know a great deal of the sordid and sullied history of these two Clans.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumors that Enoch continued to exist in the realms of the dead, and that recently it has been destroyed once more.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are have heard of some of the very obscure Paths of Enlightment. These include the Path of Lillith, a Path dealing with the wisdom imparted through various obscure writings and preaching enlightenment through pain; the Path of Orion, a Path which emphasizes continuous predatory hunting of any and all weaker creatures as a means toward vampiric evolution; the Path the Path of Paradox, a path of Vedic Brahminist sentiment now almost exclusive to the near-extinct Ravnos; and the Sharia El-Sama, a Path developed in conjunction with the tenants of Islam. You have an inkling that there are probably other Paths even more obscure than this, but that you would need considerable knowledge of very specific Lores to have heard of them.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are fully aware of the existence of the Inconnu and have heard rumors of the Black Hand as more than just a Sabbat organization.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You can name every Antediluvian as well as several prominent Methuselahs... and you're beginning to have suspicions as to where a few of them might be slumbering.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that is a Cainite dies a blameless, good and purely selfless death on the behalf of another that they may be gifted with a mortal death. What good this does the dead Cainite/mortal, however, is hard to say. (VtM [Rev]: 231)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are intimately familiar with multiple Gehenna prophecies and cults. Frankly, you should be starting to get worried...
