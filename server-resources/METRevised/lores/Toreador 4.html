        You have heard of "The Lovers", two Cainites of the Second Generation, who committed suicide upon realizing that they could no longer consummate their love. It is said that Caine forswore ever embracing childer on this event, and that the rest of his lineage is cursed because he broke his oath. You have also heard that it was Caine who disfigured the Nosferatu for mentioning "The Lovers" to him, stirring up painful memories (Although this contradicts the story that he disfigured himself out of vanity).

        You have heard bizarre tales that explain much of Greek myth in relation to the Toreador Clan. You have heard for example, that the Minotaur was a Toreador-Embraced wight, and that the myth of Tantalus is really about a feud between a Toreador and a Ventrue posing as Gods.

        You are familiar with the history behind the post-Roman Toreador, and know of the Toreador/Ventrue alliances during the age of Charlemange. You have heard of the Grand Court in France, and of the tragic tale of Alexander and the Rose of Lorraine.

        You've heard of some of the fairly obscure Toreador of note, such as Genevieve Orseau, the current head of the largest Toreador run art school of the modern era, and rumored to be one of the only descendants of the mythical Fae to have survived the Embrace.
