    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Dark Kingdom of Jade (the lands that govern the souls of the Asian dead), the Dark Kingdom of Ivory (the Lands that govern the African dead), the Dark Kingdom of Clay (the lands that govern the Australian dead), the Dark Kingdom of Obsidian (which formerly governed the lands of the Americas until Stygian invasion) and Swar (the City of the Indian dead). You may have heard rumors of other kingdoms or realms, depending on your focus and geographical region. You may also know that some of the wraiths of other lands possess strange and different powers from Western Arcanoi. (See an ST for details)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Great Maelstroms which have swept the underworld historically, you know that they wreak vast destruction and that they often occur in conjunction with great and traumatic upheavals in the Skinlands (ex: The Black Plague, the World Wars, etc...).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with all eight legions. These include: The Iron Legion (the victims of Age), the Skeletal Legion (the victims of disease), the Grim Legion (the victims of violence), the Penitent Legion (the victims of Madness), the Emerald Legion (the victims of happenstance), the Silent Legion (the victims of Despair), the Legion of Paupers (the victims of mystery), and the Legion of Fate (victims marked by fortune for this legion). You have a rough idea of the civil and military ranks within each legion.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of the three forbidden Arcanoi of Stygia. These include Flux (the ability to engender decay in the lands of the living), Mnemosynis (the ability to read and trace memories), and Intimation (the ability to implant suggestions or commands).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of all fifteen of the Guilds, including those which are illegal or forbidden.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Malfeans, who are either old spectres of immense power and malevolence, or great and terrible beings of nothingness spawned by Oblivion itself. You know that these beings head the hierarchy of the Labyrinth, and that they occasionally build cults of mortal followers in the lands of the living.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have a scant idea of Spectral social structure and know of some of the varying types of spectres, including Dopplegangers (recently shadow-eaten spectres who can attempt to pass themselves off as normal ghosts), Shades (spectres whose Psyche was destroyed in a Maelstrom or Harrowing), Nephwracks (more powerful spectres who might become Malfeans with time), and Mortwrights (ghosts who died in such violent and traumatic ways that they entered the Shadowlands as spectres).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of a few of the Dark Arcanoi (See an ST for details).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Risen, the ghosts that claw their way back into their bodies and walk among the living. You know that they lack the signs of life and can (and do) often pass themselves off a neonate Caitiff in vampiric society. You know they are extraordinarily hard to kill, but that they often have either some form of trinket or animal companion, whose destruction can disrupt them considerably.
