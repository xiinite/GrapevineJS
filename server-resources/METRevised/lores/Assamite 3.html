    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have heard the stories of how Haqim created each caste in the Second City, of how he founded Alamut from a solid mountain by striking it with his spear, and of how he eventually left, disgusted with his childer's bickering. (PGttLC: 16-17; CbA [Rev]: 9-11)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have heard some bizarre apocryphal legends that claim that Haqim was somehow responsible for his own Embrace, and that he was opposed from the beginning to the works of Khayyin (Caine) and his childer. You know that no modern loyalists in Clan Assamite hold this viewpoint. (CbA: 13-14)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You know about the series of events in the First Anarch Revolt that led to the Tremere curse and have probably read the Treaty of Tyre. You are aware that the Clan at the time refused to capitulate and join the Camarilla. (CbA: 15-17; CbA [Rev]: 24-26; LotN [Rev]: 46-47)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You know that prior to the lifting of the curse, Assamite sorcerers were said to have created a ritual whereby one could create a false diablerie through the rarification of accumulated blood, and this is why the warrior-assassins for so long accepted blood as payment for their services and tithed it to their Sires. (LS3: 59)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You are aware that the "true" Path of Blood, sometimes classically referred to as the Tariq el-Haqim, was not practiced in it's current "pure" form for a vast period of time, as it largely fell out of practice in all regions save Alamut proper after the Clan's defeat following the Second Anarch Revolt. You know that it has largely been revived due to the return of Ur-Shulgi and the breaking of the Tremere Curse. (CtB: 35-39)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have heard rumors that one of the major Paths of Enlightenment within the Sabbat was created by Assamite antitribu. (CtB: 43)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You are familiar with the Council of Scrolls, an organization of the Sorcerer and Vizier castes dedicated to assorted scholarly pursuits. You know that the Council holds fifteen seats as follows: The Seat of sums, dedicated to mathematical pursuits; The Seat of Copper and Lightening, dedicated to Electrical Science and Computer Technology; The Seat of Mirrors, dedicated to surveillance and information transfer; The Seat of Storms, dedicated to natural sciences; The Seat of the Book, dedicated to theology and philosophy; The Seat of Fire and Steel, dedicated to weapons technology; The Seat of Wheel, Whig and Oar, dedicated to transportation technology; The Seat of Glass and Smoke, dedicated to chemistry and alchemy; The Seat of Mists, dedicated to spiritualism; The Seat of Gold, dedicated to economic science; The Seat of Dust and Bone, dedicated to archeology; The Seat of Wind and Stone, dedicated to mortal politics; The Seat of Tongues, dedicated to linguistics; The Seat of Stars, dedicated to astronomy and astrology, and the Seat of Flesh, dedicated to medicine. (CbA [Rev]: 39)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You are aware that there are slight abnormalities inherent to each of the castes, similar to Clan flaws. You know that the Viziers tend to be maddeningly obsessive about their specializations; that the sorcerers seem to be constantly imbued with the aura of their blood magic; and that the warriors always show signs of diablerie (regardless of whether or not they have performed the deed). (CbA [Rev]: 38-46)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You are aware of some of the terms used to describe ranks of the various castes. You know that among Warriors, one can range from the rank of fida'i (a young initiate) to rafiq (a self sufficient combatant). Among Viziers and Sorcerers, the ranking goes from Aspirant (any scholar not yet proven) all the way to Full Master. (CbA [Rev]: 36-38; LotN [Rev]: 46)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have heard of the order of female warriors known as the Sisterhood of the Erinyes, and of the "Thousand-Meter Club," an informal grouping of any Assamites who have managed to kill another Kindred from a kilometer away or more. (CbA [Rev]: 56-57, 60)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You are aware that the antitribu made up the bulk of the Sabbat's elite fighting force, the Black Hand. (CbA [Rev]: 54)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You are aware that the Assamites have been credited with embracing such historical figures as Mata Hari (although this is disputed by the Ravnos). (CbA [Rev]: 98)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have heard of the Heartsblood, a mystical well once rumored to be within Alamut. It is said to bubble with the Cainite vitae of any and all Assamites who ever poured their own blood into it as was once customary for pilgrims to Alamut. You know that in olden times all Assamites were expected to make such a pilgrimage within the first seven years of their Embrace. (CbA: 25; PGttLC: 18; LS3: 51, 54)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have heard of the Leopards of Zion, a uniquely Jewish Assamite order. You also know of the now defunct Spear of Destiny, a similar Christian group that was eliminated in the Dark Ages. (LS3: 63)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have at least heard, in passing, of famous Assamites such as: Djuhah, one of the four Seraphs of the Black Hand, and the former disciple of Izhim Ur-Baal; Fatima al-Faqadi, a famous high-ranking assassin among the warriors; and Tariq the Silent, a serial diablerist who ranks amongst the most highly sought anathema of the Camarilla, and also serves as a Dominion of the Black hand. (CbA: 66; CbA [Rev]: 95-96; KmW: 69-72)
