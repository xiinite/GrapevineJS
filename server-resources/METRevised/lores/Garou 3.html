    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that werewolves, in human form, retain a meausure of supernatural strength and heightened awareness, giving them a significant edge over average mortal.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that werewolves, in wolf form, are able to shrug off most supernatural powers. You also hear that they seem to be more capable of healing injury, to the point where wounds vanish from their skin seconds after being struck. You know that the wolf form also becomes more powerful and ferocious after consuming human flesh, and that it is able to perform fantastical feats of strength, speed and endurance as a result.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You also know that many werewolves try to refrain from eating the flesh of man, even if they do seem to have a supernatural urge to do so, and that werewolves avoid cities mostly for fear of losing their control around so many people. The love of natural wilderness is a secondary motivation.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that some werewolves are more powerful than others, but that it has been observed that there is a rough but direct correlation between a werewolf's power and how uncontrollable it's actions are. You suspect that this may be related to why some werewolves try to refrain from flesh eating.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that werewolves can also be born into the curse instead of being bitten, if one of their parents (usually the father) is a werewolf. Such werewolves tend to be more powerful, and almost universally are alphas of their packs. You also know that the rumor regarding lycanthropy being spread through sex is a myth, and that the lovers of werewolves who inherit the curse have always been bitten at some point.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that all those who receive the bite of a werewolves tend to be slightly "infected" with the curse, and may exhibit symptoms of lycanthropy without transforming. These symptoms include irritability, lack of self control, sadistic fantasies, and sporadic sharpening of the senses or sudden increases to physical strength. You know further, that such lycanthropically affected mortals can live out their entire lives without once transforming into a wolf.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that no Cainite has ever been transformed into a werewolf by a lycanthrope's bite, and that no werewolf has ever been successfully Embraced.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that there is some sort of supernatural bond between the alpha and the wolves within his or her pack, although you aren't certain what this entails.
