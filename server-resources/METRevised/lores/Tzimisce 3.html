    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that the Antediluvian fell into slumber for several centuries after being attacked by warring Salubri. Oddly, some accounts of this event have Tzimisce being killed in the fray, although this clearly cannot be true if Lugoj managed to diablerize him centuries later.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know what Kupala is, a demon spirit native to the region in which Tzimisce settled, that the eldest supposedly made a pact with. You know that it is because of this spirit (who is itself bound to the land) that the Tzimisce are likewise bound to their native soil. You also know that it is supposedly the origin of koldunic sorcery.

        You have heard of the legend of Kupala's fire flower, which was the key ingredient that Lugoj needed to break the bond.

        You that the Old Clan Tzimisce have created an organization known as the Ordea League, consisting of twelve of their eldest. You know it is unwise to meddle in their affairs.

        You know a bit about the structure of the Children of Dracon. You know that it operates from the Hagia Sophia and that it resembles a monastic order in practice. You know that the order is split into two branches, the scholarly branch (Akoimetai) and the knightly branch.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of such movements as: the Neofeudalists, Tzimisce who seek to recreate their Lord/serf hierarchies in a modern setting; the Exsanguinists, Tzimisce who believe that drinking blood impedes enlightenment and engage in ritualistic vampiric anorexia as a result; and the Reclaimists, those who believe diablerie to be essential to understanding the vampiric condition, and spend most of their time in zulo form waiting to commit it.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard legends of the Cathedral of Flesh, a fantastical structure created by Yorak out of thousands of human victims. You know that it disappeared from it's place in Transylvannia centuries ago and many rumors abound as to what became of it.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that each of the Revanent families have a specific disposition for certain vampiric Disciplines and that each House also bears certain inherited weaknesses. You know that the Bratovich employ the Disciplines Animalism, Potence and Vicissitude and they have inherently bad tempers and are prone to flying into rages. You know that the Grimaldi employ the Disciplines Celerity, Dominate and Fortitude and each one of them serves on Sabbat member as a thrall to a blood bond. You know that the Obterus employ the Disciplines Auspex, Obfuscate and Vicissitude and have a tendency to become engrossed in their work to the point of derangement. You know that the Zantosa employ the Disciplines Auspex, Presence and Vicissitude and find it very easy to succumb to mortal temptation.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with the Romanian Legacy foundation, a group masquerading as a mortal genealogy studies organization which seeks to track down mortals with Revanent blood that the family has "lost".
