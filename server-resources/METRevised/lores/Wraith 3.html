<h3>Lore: Wraith x3</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know about the Tempest - a sprawling roiling sea of magma, nightmares, acid, burning plasm, and horrific beasties that underlies the Shadowlands. You know that it is particularly hazardous to travel, and that occasionally storms (known as Maelstroms) whip the Tempest into a fervor - making it even more unstable.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of Stygia, the great Necropoli that underlies the Tempest, and the bulwark of the Heirachy. You know that the Hierarchy was allegedly founded by an enigmatic figure known as Charon, and you have a rough idea as to what legions are.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Dictum Mortuum (or Code of the Dead), a Hierarchy legal code forbidding interaction between the living and the dead. You realize that by having this lore level, you probably are helping to violate said code.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard rumors of something that lies beneath Stygia - and it sounds to be something nightmarish. You know that whatever it is, it is connected with spectres.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of the two rough political categories that stand in opposition to the Hierarchy. These are the Renegades (Wraiths that claim no allegiance to the Hierarchy, or even actively seek to dismantle it) and Heretics (Those Wraiths that follow various religious or spiritual ideologies in the hopes of transcending from the Underworld).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the Guilds, organizations which formerly offered instruction in the arts of various Arcanoi in the past.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with some of the less common Arcanoi which Wraiths use to interact with the Skinlands, and even a few Arcanoi that have little use outside the lands of the dead. These include: Argos (The ability to cross the Tempest safely), Inhabit (The ability to possess and manipulate mechanical and electronic devices), Keening (The ability to invoke emotion through song), and Moliate (the ability to change and mold plasm - somewhat akin to the Discipline Vicissitude if you've encountered it).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the two halves of the Wraith mind are the Psyche and the Shadow, and that the Shadow forever wishes to corrupt it's host and render them a spectre. You have heard of the concept of Harrowings, in which a wraith is confronted by it's Shadow in a traumatic passion play during times of distress or physical suffering.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with the concept of Oblivion - a nihilistic force which embodies the very essence of entropy. You know that it is this force that wraiths fear most, and that they believe that spectres are in direct service to it.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of the art of soulforging, in which a wraith's corpus (Plasm) is heated to malleability and they are shaped into an object. You know that aside from relics, this horrific process is one of the only ways to get material goods in the Underworld, and that this is generally a punishment reserved for criminals.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of barghests - wraiths whose corpus has been altered into the shape of a dog-like creature that they might be used as a tracking animal.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know enough about the restless dead to realize that a Cainite, had they the will to do so, could land among their number after final death.
