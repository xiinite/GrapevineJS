<h3>Lore: Anarch x1</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Anarch movement stands for the right of Cainites to act as their own self-governing entities,
        without complete subservience to elders. (LotN [Rev]: 255-256)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Anarch movement is technically a sub-sect of the Camarilla.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">You are aware that the movement is made up primarily of Neonates and Ancillae, who often identify with mortal
        gang/biker culture and are more prone to adopting uncommonly nomadic lifestyles for Kindred. (GttA: 195-213;
        LotN [Rev]: 255-256)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">You know that a high percentage of Anarchs tend to be drawn from Clan Brujah. (GttA: 22-24; LotN [Rev]: 30; VtM
        [Rev]: 68)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">You know about the Second Anarch Revolt (and hence can assume there was a First Anarch Revolt), and of the
        existence of the West coast Anarch Free State, even if it has fallen. You know who Jeremy MacNeil is. (CbB:
        17-19, 64-65; CbB [Rev]: 26-30; GttA: 22-24)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">You are familiar with the concept of a Baron (the rough Anarch equivalent of a Prince) and with the concept of
        baronies. You understand that a Baron usually doesn't quite possess the political clout of a Prince, and that
        they are not by necessity the eldest or most powerful Cainite in the local Sect. (GttA: 50-52)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">You know that Anarch gangs often engage in elaborate hazing rituals, although this practice has fallen out of
        practice somewhat since the late 90s.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">You know how to play a game of Nines. (It's like paintball... only with .9 mm pistols.) (GttA: 72)
    </li>
