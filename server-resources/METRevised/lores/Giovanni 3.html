        You know that Augustus was Embraced by Cappadocius in 1005 AD, somewhere in the region of modern day Turkey, and that the Giovanni bloodline was galvanized when he later diablerized his Sire and had his now-Cappadocian-Embraced family hunt down and destroy the remainder of the original Clan. (CbGi: 13-14; CbGi [Rev]: 20; PGttHC: 136)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard that the "Curse of the Lamia" comes from Augustus' diablerie of Lamia, the leader of a now forgotten vampiric bloodline and cult which served the Cappadocians. Allegedly, the Lamiae were focused on rituals and magic involving the spread of infection and disease, and it's not inconceivable that such a curse might originate from them. (CbGi: 14; CbGi [Rev]: 22)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard tell of the Jovians' affairs in both supernatural and mortal politics. You know that there are rumors of Jovian involvement in the Punic Wars and by extention the Ventrue/Brujah conflict of the times, with ocassional hints that they knew of the vampiric interests in Carthage. You further know that Flavius Iovianus, emperor of the Roman Empire in 364-365 AD, was allegedly of Jovian blood. (CbGi [Rev]: 18)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know the the Jovian household suffered greatly during the barbarian sacks of Rome, and that at this time the lares familiares that had traditionally guarded the family seemingly abandoned them. You know that it is for this reason that the Giovanni no longer pay much reverence to the wraiths they deal with, chosing instead to use coercion and force rather than praise and oblation. For reasons not quite known, however, you know that the great Dis Pater is still held in high regard, especially amongst the anziani and even by Augustus himself. Futhermore, you know that the family's current ties to the region of Venice are a result of their flight from the city of Rome proper, and that the surname Giovanni was later adopted as a result of the Iconoclastic religious controversy (They did not want to seem irreverant in having the name of Jove in their surname). (CbGi [Rev]: 17-19)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of the Premascines, ancient Giovanni elders who dwell below the surface of the waters in Venice, and supposedly trace their lineage to before the diablerie of Cappadocius. You know that some anziani are apparently still in communication with them. (CbGi: 35-37; CbGi [Rev]: 23-25)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Scottish Dunsirn are reputably cannibals, and have heard some words as to how they killed the faction of the family that had less interesting culinary preferences. They were brought into the Giovanni fold sometime in the 1700s, as Augustus was apparently impressed with their financial prowess. (CbGi: 28-29; CbGi [Rev]: 29-30)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Pisanob are descended from a loose conglomeration of native Aztec priests encountered during Cortez's expeditions, and that they are not originally a single family. You know that they were brought into the Clan for allegedly possessing a number of new and potent ritual magics complementary to Necromancy. (CbGi: 29-32; CbGi [Rev]: 30-31)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Milliners have been Embraced into the family only over the past fifty years or so. You have heard stories regarding their ongoing feud with the Kennedys and there is speculation as to precisely how much of that mortal family's misfortune they are responsible for. (CbGi: 29-32; CbGi [Rev]: 31-32)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of some of the less common Doppio Sangue (Double Blood). These include the della Passaglia, a merchant family absorbed in the 1400s who have inroads into the Orient and a renown as opium sellers; the Ghiberti, a family of former slave traders involved in the West Indies and Africa; the Putanesca, a Sicilian family with a reputation as low-class criminals; and the Rosselini, a former rival family of Necromancers with a penchant for sadism. (CbGi: 32-33; CbGi [Rev]: 32-33)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know about the existence of the Harbingers of Skulls and the Samedi, and you know that these vampiric bloodlines can also practice Necromancy. You also have heard a few whispers of the Nagaraja, a now extinct bloodline with similar capabilities. (CbGi: 65)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are fully familiar with all of the terms of the treaty known as the Promise of 1528 between the Giovanni and the Camarilla. This includes a clause in which a group of Camarilla elders will come to Venice every thirteen years to inspect operations. You further know that at the time this agreement was made, it essentially meant that the Camarilla tacitly allowed for the slaughter of the Cappadocians at Giovanni hands. (CbGi: 15-16; CbGi [Rev]: 27)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Path of Bones (or the Via Ossis) originated with Clan Cappadocian. (CbC: 39-40; CtB: 39-43)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Endless Night ritual was apparently uncovered amongst Cappadocian documents found by Claudius Giovanni (something called the Khazar's Diary) shortly before his final demise, and that it will supposedly rend the sundario apart, bringing the spirit world and the material world together as one, giving the Giovanni sway over both the living and the dead. You have also heard of that there is a small group of Giovanni who oppose this ritual, although they are widely scorned and often lead short unlives when their sentiments are uncovered. (CbGi: 14-16; CbGi [Rev]: 26-27, 52)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that April 4th is celebrated because it is said to be the day that Augustus made the decision to diablerize Cappadocius back in 1444 AD. (CbGi [Rev]: 27, 49)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have at least heard, in passing, of famous Giovanni such as: Ambrogino Giovanni, a scholar of various Cappadocian texts and ancient magics who has been searching for a rare artifact known as the Sargon Fragment; Genevra Giovanni, a necromancer who did extensive work with the Catholic Inquisition and who enacted a great many profitable agreements with the Sabbat before her death in Boston in 1999; and Isabel Giovanni, a spy who has managed to pose as multiple figures in the Sabbat and Camarilla. (CbGi: 64; CbGi [Rev]: 99; CotI: 59-61; GC2; GC3; GC4: 100-)
