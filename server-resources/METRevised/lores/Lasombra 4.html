        You know a little more about Gratiano's machinations to destroy the Eldest, and that he sough to create an atmospheer of paranoia by having prisoners with layers upon layers of false memory implanted in them by Assamite allies to indicate that Montano was an Anarch sympathizer.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that Montano was born to the Masai near Kilimanjaro, and that his original name was Ontai. You know that he was, in fact, selected from a young age to be the an apprentice to the "pale visitor" and that it was only after the threat of his people's destuction that he swore loyalty to the Eldest. You know that even now, Montano still considers himself under oath to the Lasombra Antediluvian, and that he current actions to this night are informed by what he considers his master's best interests.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that before the foundation of the Sabbat, consent was an imperative part of any Lasombra Embrace, and that the majority of the Clan found the idea of Embracing an unwilling mortal completely abhorrent. You are painfully aware that the marital realities of the modern clan have caused this tenant to fall out of practice, although some elders and most antitribu still hold to it. (LS1: 23-24)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know have heard some Lasombra historians attempt to claim credit for the Hyskos-controlled Dynasties of Egypt, although the majority of Setite scholars with dispute this vehemently. (PGttHC: 33)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Lasombra entanglement in the Reconquista led to a great deal of veneration for Rodrigo DÏaz de Vivar (El Cid), and have heard rumors that he was offered the Embrace. You are aware of the bygone tradition in medieval Spain for Christian Lasombra to keep vigil over the bones of Rodrigo DÏaz de Vivar (El Cid) at their resting place in Burgos Cathedral near Valencia. You also know that the politics of the Shadow Reconquista briefly caused a phenomenon in which the Les Amies Noir (called the Amici Nocti at the time) essentially split into two seperate bodies in the region, with the Moorish Lasombra taking council from the Asdiqa' Al-Lail (IbN: 84-86; LS1: 17)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the reason for the Lasombra backed destruction of the Aztecs was that they hoped that by ceasing blood sacrifices to the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli, they might actually prevent the sun from ever rising again. (CbL [Rev]: 27)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that a group of sea-faring Lasombra have seized a Soviet Kilo-class sub from Iran known as The Black Fang, and that they now conduct raids on Camarilla-based shipping from it. You have even heard that the Les Amies Noir have even granted them permission to kill fellow Clanmates who interfere with their operations. (CbL [Rev]: 59)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard some rumor of Lasombra mystics being able to summon creatures from the Abyss, or being able to physically travel into some sort of Abyssal realm. You have even heard rumor that such powers were incidental in Mon«ada's destruction and have heard whispers that the art of Obtenebraetion in some way links to the world of ghosts and the restless dead. (CbL: 35; CbL [Rev]: 73, 96)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that amongst the upper levels of the Les Amies Noir, Sect has become less of a concern and you have even heard of antitribu who serve upon or who invoke Courts of Blood. You are also able to identify a sizable portion of Les Amies Noir in your region. (CbL [Rev]: 53)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Kiasyd are a Lasombra bloodline and are aware that they were created through some manner of experimentation involving both the fae and the Abyss. You know that the Kiasyd are consummate scholars and that there have apparently been some interactions with their parent Clan regarding the trade of information and books. (LS1: 28-29)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of Zarathustra, an ancient Lasombra who inhabits and watches over Antioch and who has largely remained distant from the tumult of Clan politics. You do not know if he bears any relation to the legendary Zoroaster from whom he takes his name. (CbL [Rev]: 97)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of some of the fairly obscure Lasombra of note, such as Alfonso Lopez, an infamous antitribu who escaped the purges of the 15th century; Black Wallace, one of the more feared Inquisitors since the late 18th century; Leila Monroe, a hopeful self-declared Priscus who has been struggling to tip the balance of Los Angeles in favor of the Sabbat; and Lisette Visquel, an extremely young initiate into the Les Amies Noir who was placed in charge of a series of raids in Miami and the Florida keys. (CbL: 67-68; CotN: 18-20, 26-27)
