<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that the Malkavian Discipline shift was not, in reality, a matter of choice, and that a massive conclave of Malkavians was held in the city of Domazlice, where six Methusaleh's (Addemar, the Black Hag, the Dionysian, the Plague-Bride, Tryposa and Unmada) caused a "block" to be placed in the minds of their brethren, psychically shutting them off from the powers of Dementation. You are aware that people in the know about this "prank" historically regard the Camarilla Malkavians as the technical antitribu of the Clan. (CbM [Rev]: 27-30, 34)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard some versions of the story of Malkav, in which he is driven mad after either sleeping with Lillith or after having her unveil to him certain forbidden "truths." You know that in these myths that feature Lillith, Malkav is said to have infected Set and Saulot with his madness as they tried to comfort him. (CbM [Rev]: 13; CtB: 47; PGttLC: 37)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard legends relating that prior to Malkav's rending he was visited by an angel or angels of the Lord, who imparted unto him certain revelations that were meant to secure Caine's repentance, and that he then approached Caine and spoke to him. Caine, in rage, was said to have struck him down for this attempt and to have then cursed his descendants with insanity. (LS4: 101, 117)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that the Malkavian Madness Network is not just the device of Malkav or a part of the Clan curse but rather that it is Malkav himself, who exists now in shards throughout the minds of all his progeny. You know that the Coronati, by devouring Malkav's blood, allowed him to exist in them and in all they Embraced. You know that they are said to never meet, such as that should something attempt to kill them, all of the original fragments of Malkav will not fall at once. (CbM [Rev]: 12-13, 42, 58-59; PGttLC: 37)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard in Jerusalem in the late 12th century, the waterways and fountains of the area were said to have turned red with blood, and that many elder Cainites report having had strange and terrible dreams at the time. You have heard scant reports that it was during this time that something was discovered beneath the city, and have heard rumors to the effect that Malkav was active at this point in history. (FoBC: 19; 27-28)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        Even if you are not a member of one of the Orders of Mystery, you know of the rough ranks of progression through one of these groups. You know that the each order is led by a deacon, a Malkavian who claims to have been present at Malkav's original "rending", and that the majority of each order is made up of mystai who graduate from the entrant's rank of initiate after a year of study. You also have a fair amount of familiarity with the litany and practices of both the Ordo Aenigmatis and Ordo Ecstasis, and you've heard tell of the (hopefully) now defunct third order, the infernalist Ordo Maleficus. (LS4: 95-100; PGttLC: 219)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that some truly believed that the "Language of Babel" was, in fact, related to the biblical myth of its name, and that at the time that the tower of Babel fell, Duma, the archangel of silence, descended upon the earth and blessed seventy-seven members of the Clan such as that they would remember the first tongue. (LS4: 93, 112; PGttLC: 38)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of two nearly unknown and utterly minuscule bloodlines of Clan Malkavian: The Mnemosyne and the Jocastatians. You know that both groups are said to specialize in Noddist scholarship and to practice ritual diablerie, but you know little else. (CtB: 47)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of Elmolech, a demon bound into a human body by a gathering of Malkavians after it had tried to possess the body of Geniveive of Limoge, an elder of the Clan. You know that Elmolech has hence been cursed to wander the earth eternally, and that several Malkavians claim to have had brushes with it. (CbM [Rev]: 22)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of Adonijah, the Biblical son of David who allegedly had (and has) some manner of relation to Clan Malkavian and it's founder. You have heard all manner of contradictory rumors about this individual, but know that he is said to still be wandering the earth - albeit not as a Cainite. You have heard that he was entrusted with something extraordinarily precious. (FoBC: 23-25)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of the Book of Andreas, a lost religious text that makes the claim that Christ had a Cainite disciple in his company - a Malkavian named Andreas who was exhorted to seek Caine out and beg forgiveness, and thereby achieve redemption before God. You have heard that this sripture formed the basis for a highly heretical military-religious sect known as the Brotherhood of the Crooked Cross, which claimed to worship the divine trinity in the form of Caine the Father, Christ the Son, and Malkav the holy ghost. (LS4: 89, 93; PGttLC: 39).

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of the obscure Biblia Negra, an Spanish translation of certain works set down by an Arab author. You are aware that it is said that the text has certain startling Noddist sentiments to it regarding the intentions of sixty seven beings of great power that sleep beneath the earth. You are aware that the original translator was a Malkavian, and that all known owners of the text have succumb to some form of insanity or paranoia. (LS4: 95).

        You know that Camilla Banes was alleged to have been involved in some way with the Antediluvian of the "Clan of Death". (GC2 17-20; GC3 15-16)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of some of the fairly obscure Malkavians of note, such as: Lamdiel, a famous prophet of Jerusalem; "Le' Enfant Perdu," the former Prince of Antwerp; and Quentin King III and the six Knights of Boston, who rule over Boston and the surrounding areas and who all seem to share in the delusion that they are part of an Arthurian Romance. (CbM [Rev]: 19; LS4: 94)
