        Holy $*#%! Ghosts exist! They are dead people! They can haunt you in all manner of woogity ways!

        You know that ghosts are the souls of those who have died with "unfinished business," and that they cannot find peace until they accomplish whatever this business was.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that ghosts have no physical bodies in the same sense as the living, and that their bodies are made from a substance known as plasm.

        You know that wraiths are creatures of emotion, and that they seek out feelings that are important to them individually. You know that most wraiths you will encounter have artifacts connected to them known as "fetters" (items which werew personally important to them in life), and that they treasure these things greatly. You know that whomever holds a fetter can carry a great deal of sway over a wraith.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that there is a barrier called the "Shroud" that separates the land of the dead from the land of the living, and that ghosts often have trouble employing all of their powers fully on people because of this. You know that the Shroud tends to be weaker in places permeated by death (graveyards, murder sites, Elysia) and that interactions with ghosts may be less difficult there (on both sides).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard of a variety of ghostly powers that wraiths may employ, including visual manifestation to the living, poltergeist-like activity, and possession.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that some ghosts are decidedly more malevolent than others, and that these are called spectres.
