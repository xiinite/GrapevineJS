        You are aware of the contents of the legendary dialog between Caine and Malkav in which Malkav sought to redeem him. and you know that key to the argument was Caine's refusal to answer the question "Why?" when it was posed to him by Malkav - presumably in relation to his motivation for killing Abel. (LS4: 100; 117)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard a story, Bahari in origin, that Malkav and Arikel (the Toreador Antediluvian) were the children of Lilith, and that they had a third sibling named Nahema, a woman called the Dark Muse or the Demon Queen of Madness. You know that after the deaths of these three, that Nahema was said to still speak to the blood of her siblings, and that it is her whispers that actually transmit the madness network. (CtB: 64)

        You know that one of Malkav's childer, similar in power to the Coronati, was diablerized beneath Jerusalem, and that the Antediluvian was on the verge of potentially waking in 1197 AD as a result. You have heard that Malkav himself does not lie beneath the city, but rather that the riddle to his final resting place is somehow related to the Latin phrase "Et in Arcadia Ego," made famous by the painting 'Les Bergers d'Arcadie' by Nicholas Poussin - a notable puzzle piece in many conspiracy theories. You can suspect that this clue might be related to the ocassional brushes the Clan is said to have with the Fae. (FoBC: 27-28, 31)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that the pure blood of Malkav is said to have miraculous qualities, and that imbibing it can heal the injured and mad, even to the point where it may turn back wassail. (FoBC: 25 32)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware of the ritual diablerie practiced by (presumably) all three of the Ordos in the event that initiates prove themselves unworthy. You also have made some connections between the three Coronati and the three orders of Madness. (LS4: 95-100; PGttLC: 219)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with the Mnemosyne, and are aware that they possibly can claim some manner of connection with the Dionysian. You know that their interest in scholarship has some manner of mystic compulsion to it, and that they have a seeming rivalry with the Jocastatians. You have heard of Aristotle de Laurent, who is amongst the most prominent of their line and works with various Camarilla notables on issues of research. (CtB: 47; EV: 202; Nod: 6)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with the Jocastatians, and are aware that they do, in fact, practice ritual diablerie upon their elders as a means of obtaining knowledge (not entirely dissimilar from acts ascribed to the Salubri). You know that several Jocastatians claim membership in the Sabbat. (CtB: 47; Nod: 182-183)

        You have heard that Camilla Banes had contact with the Antediluvian Cappadocius and that certain prophecies she has made about him have proved eerily accurate. (GC4: 97)
