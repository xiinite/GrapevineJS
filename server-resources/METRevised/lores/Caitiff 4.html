<h3>Lore: Caitiff x4</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know a great deal of the Noddist scholarship surrounding the Clanless and the possible prophecies of Gehenna.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are fairly cognizant of all of the varying degrees of deviation from the vampiric norm that are associated with having "Thin Blood". You have heard of those known as "Interceptors" who have been able to create new Disciplines, although you haven't any clue how this is managed.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
    You know that only vampires of the fifteenth generation have been able to successfully father/birth Dhampirs, and you are familiar with the basic abilities these undead-born humans have, such as occasionally possessing rudimentary vampiric Disciplines.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that the "Thin-blooded" who manifest "Insight" are supposedly able to gain insight into the Jyhad of the elders themselves, and know that this lends credence to the tales of the Clanless heralding Gehenna.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You've heard of some of the fairly obscure Caitiff of note, such as: Alexei Darba, who attempted to do for the Camarilla what Jospeh Pander did for the Sabbat.
