        You have heard that according to a mix of Yoyari and Romani legends, Laetshi was the first to teach Ravnos the art of Chimestry rather than Kaen, but that she taught him a true, pure form of the Discipline which allowed him to change the world in a direct and palpable manner. It is said by adherents of the false Path of Paradox, that Ravnos later lost this power, owing to the fact that the other Antediluvians hoarded the weig of the world for themselves, making it impossible to change. (CbR: 41)

        You have heard that the true ending of the Karavalanisha Vrana was said in antiquity to contain a secret so dire, that were it revealed, all of the Ravnos Clan would turn upon one another in frenzy and despair. You see how this could be seen as prophetic, given the aftermath of the Week of Nightmares. (LS4: 25)

        You have heard that Ramessu grew deranged over the centuries and that, in denial of the passing of Dynastic Egypt, he set up for himself an illusionary Pharaonic court, which lasted well into the Renaissance and which some speculate might still exist today. (CbR [Rev]: 23)

        You are aware that Prince Ettiene de Fauberge of Acre was brought to power by his sire Varsik, the childe of Bashir, and that he was charged by his sire with finding the True Cross in exchange for his climb to prominence. You know that this mission was apparently central to the Bashirite mission to harbor the apocalypse. (LS: 19)

        You have heard that Baba Yaga has perished, and that it is rumored that the curses she laid on Durga Syn may at long last have been lifted. (CbR [Rev]: 99)

        You know that whatever woke up in Bagledesh was fought by three of the most powerful asuratizayya (represented by a Tiger, a Dragon and a Crane in the visions of those affected by the Week of Nightmares), and that mortal magicians also interfered with affairs in some capacity. You are fairly certain that the Ravnos Antediluvian is dead. (ToTB: 125-126)
