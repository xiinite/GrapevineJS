    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that Absimilliard was Embraced by Zillah the Beautiful, of the Second Generation, and that his Embrace ocurred after he attempted to track her to her lair and destroy her. The battle apparently left a scar across his face, marring his beauty. You have further heard that later he attempted to take her life again, laying siege to the First City with his collected brood and the aid of other Antediluvians, and that for this affront he and his childer were cursed by Caine with the hideousness now inherent to the bloodline. (CbN: 14-16; CbN [Rev]: 13-14, 16-19; PGttLC: 43)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that Absimilliard created for himself a great brood of childer who were all loyal to him through the blood bond, but that one night he was said to have raped a woman he came upon bathing at a stream and Embraced her in a fit of passion. You know that it is said that all Nosferatu descend from this one woman - often titled "The Matriarch"- and that it is Nosferatu's original brood that form the enigmatic Nictuku. You know that it is said that the Nictuku hunt down all of their "cousins" at Absimilliard's behest. (CbN: 13-17; CbN [Rev]: 13-16, 17-19; PGttLC: 43)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that in his attempts to kill Zillah, Absimilliard attempted to distract Caine by claiming that he had been attacked by a Lycanthrope, and set him out on a task to destroy them for the offense. You have heard that it is for this reason that the werewolves hate all Kindred. (CbN: 15)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard a story of how Absimilliard apparently was the lover of Arikel (the Toreador Antediluvian), although few of the Clan will affirm this, and this is, oddly enough, a legend mostly perpetuated by the Toreador. (CbN [Rev]: 20)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that the Nosferatu had a large presence in ancient Rome and that they helped to orchestrate and maintain the building of the Cloaca Maxima there, as well as the Christian catacombs that followed it. (CbN [Rev]: 22; PGttLC: 45; LS: 53)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that many Nosferatu do not survive their Embrace, and that several others emerge as simplistic brutes, malformed to the point that they are incapable of higher thought or basic survival skills. You've heard rumors that some Nosferatu who beget such abominations hide their childer deep underground and attempt to feed and care for them, in spite of their vegetative state. (CbN: 19; CbN [Rev]: 43-44, 46)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that there is allegedly a tendency for Camarilla Nosferatu to dwell below ground in sewage drains and subways, whereas their Sabbat counterparts are more frequently found above ground in blighted urban areas. You are furthermore aware that Sabbat, Camarilla and Autarkis Nosferatu will often speak with one another on Clan matters when removed from the sight of their respective Sects. (CbN [Rev]: 24, 54-55)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know the basic stereotypical social classifications given to Nosferatu. These include: Bestials, who are obsessed with the Animalism Discipline and who tend to develop large clusters of ghouled beasts; Cleopatras, who were beautiful and vain as mortals and have been Embraced as a form of punishment; Fagins, who tend to head crime rings and use blood cults to network in poverty-stricken areas; Leatherfaces, who have degenerated into maddened serial killers; Loremasters, who study and trade in knowledge and obscure information; Martyrs, who see their curse as a divine punishment and strive to retain their Humanity and moral high ground; and Skins, who compulsively use Obfuscate to sttempt to blend in with human society. (CbN: 22, 28-29; CbN [Rev]: 44-50)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that a Brood is a collective of Nosferatu working together, and that it differs from a Coterie (Broods tend to be more familial and have a greater sense of interdependence). You also know that a gathering of Nosferatu for discussion, barter or socializing is referred to as a Hosting. (CbN: 28; CbN [Rev]: 52-54)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know some of the traditional games that Nosferatu broods play, such as round-robin (a large circular gossip session in which all present attempt to tell the story of the city's current events), and the aranta-shadur, or scavenger hunt, in which Nosferatu are given a list of items in the city to be obtained through theft and subterfuge by the end of the night. (CbN: 30-31; CbN [Rev]: 64)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware of the general layout of a Nosferatu warren. You know that there is traditionally an labyrinthine antechamber through which visitors must navigate to gain an audience, and that the central room of the warren (often referred to as the "Chamber of Horrors") is generally the most defensible place in the structure. You further know that almost all warrens are elaborately booby-trapped and are very hard to penetrate without foreknowledge of their defenses. (CbN: 36-37; CbN [Rev]: 59-60)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with spawning pools (waterways tainted with Nosferatu blood) and know that they are used to create massive broods of mutated animal thralls. (CbN [Rev]: 37-28; 60-61)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that some Nosferatu who dwell underground can develop a penchant bizarre forms of art, in particular: music, gardening and sculpture. You have heard of the development of acoustic subterranean chambers -some of which employ channeled water, and of fantastical gardens with fungi the size of trees. You are also aware of the "Escalera", a giant sculpture of twisted metal and piping that spans an underground chasm in Lima - and that is a popular tourist spot for Nosferatu who are aware of it. (CbN: 34; CbN [Rev]: 64-65)

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have heard that the Nosferatu formerly held a roughly codified set of ethics of hospitality throughout Europe, but that these practices are generally only now adhered to by elders of the Clan. (LS4: 56)

    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have at least heard, in passing, of legendary Nosferatu such as Baba Yaga, the infamous witch hag who is said to have ruled the entirety of Russia from the shadows. (CbN [Rev]: 100; NoP: 100-102; RaR: 89-91)
