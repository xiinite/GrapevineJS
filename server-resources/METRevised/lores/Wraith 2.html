<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that only those people who died with a significant personal drive to cling to those things important to them (even beyond death!) can become wraiths, and that such people are not common. You know that not everyone who dies becomes a wraith.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that wraiths horde and prize raw emotion, referring to it as "Pathos", and that they can derive this either from close proximity to their fetters, or from siphoning it from others (living or dead) who feel the emotion they desire.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know about the existence of the Shadowlands, a mirror version of the material world which the dead inhabit. You know that the Shadowlands is a direct correspondence to the lands of the living, save that structures and objects which have been destroyed still remain there if they persist in human memory. You know that most major cities have analogues in the Shadowlands called Necropoli.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that wraiths can only frequent the Shadowlands if they still have extant fetters to hold them in close proximity to the land of the living.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that some wraiths appear such as that they have no sentience, and only re-enact their deaths repeatedly. These are called drones.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know of the existence of relics, items that contained enough emotional resonance, that when they were destroyed, they appeared as physical items in the shadowlands. You know that they are highly treasured in wraith society where materials are scarce.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that wraiths have a fairly diverse political and hierarchical structure, and you have heard of the Hierarchy - the body that governs over most wraiths you will encounter in European civilization, although you can glean very little about it.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that ghosts have an innate ability to discern the emotional resonance and the state of decay of things. Wraiths may be able to tell when a person is angry or sorrowful. They may also be able to tell if a person is close to deat or if a building is near collapse.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are familiar with some of the more common Arcanoi which Wraiths use to interact with the "skinlands" as they call them. These include: Embody (The ability to speak with or appear to the living), Outrage (The ability to cause manipulate and/or throw around physical objects), Pandemonium (The ability to cause surreal or strange effects - walls bleeding, time slowing down etc...), and Puppetry (The ability to possess and manipulate mortal hosts).

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You are aware that all wraiths possess a schism to their personality which causes a darker counterpart to appear. You know that this secondary personality may occasionally attempt to overpower the wraith's actions against it's will. You know that if this happens to often the ghost will "go bad" and become a spectre.
