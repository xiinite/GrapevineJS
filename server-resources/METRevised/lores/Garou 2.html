<h3>Lore: Garou x2</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that werewolves, like vampires, do not age and could technically be considered immortal. You know that they are capable of recoving from injury or healing wounds at an exceptional rate, even more swiftly than a Kindred. You are aware that, not being undead and hence static creatures, they do change in phsyical appearance slightly with time, and that permanent changes may be made to their body (piercings, tattoos, amputations, etc...).
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that werewolves, in human form, tend to be incredibly healthy, robust and attractive, and that they seem to display a resistance to disease or poison.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that werewolves, in wolf form, are hideously strong, fast and large (ranging from the size of a large European wolf to the size of a very hefty male lion). You know that they are more than a match for most Kindred.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that a werewolf, when killed, reverts to it's human form.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that werewolves, either through necessity or desire, commonly eat human flesh. You know that this blood lust (and the subsequent transformation into wolf form to acheive it) can be triggered by anger, by the sound of other wolves howling, by exposure to moonlight without any artificial light sources, or by the act of sexual intercourse.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that silver causes werewolves extreme pain, and that injuries made with a silver weapon do not heal as quickly as other ones. You know that werewolves tend to get uneasy around silver objects not being wielded as weapons as well. You are aware that wolfsbane (while some werewolves display allegenic symptoms toward it) is not a universal bane.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You know that one generally becomes a werewolf by being bitten by another werewolf or by sleeping with one. You hear that this is not always the case and that many bite victims/lovers of werewolves never transform.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You have a vague idea of how pack structure functions, and are aware that every pack has an alpha, although you cannot determine how alphas are decided.
