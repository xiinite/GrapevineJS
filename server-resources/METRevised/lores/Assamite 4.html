	You have heard of the various Assamite conflicts with the Baali and how the Children of Haqim apparently fought back infernalist forces bent on overtaking the Second City. You have heard tell of how early Assamites would leave tokens of unleaved bread at the battlesites when the Baali fell. You also know the story of how Ur-Shulgi originally appeared in one of these battles, and that he is said to have single-handedly slain the entire Baali force at that time. You have also heard tell of the battle of Chorazin, and know that it is from the Baali, not Caine, that the Assamites acquired their original Clan curse to thirst after Cainite blood. (CbBaali: 25; CbA [Rev]: 12-14, 22-23; LS3: 51-53)

	You have heard further unsubstantiated legends that Haqim granted himself Cainite lineage by slaughtering the King and Queen of En'esh (Enoch) and drinking of their blood. You know that no other Cainite tradition recognizes these figures, who according to the legend were two additional members of the Second Generation (CbA: 14)

	You are aware that initiation onto the Path of Blood is no simple task, and that it requires an initiate to meditate and study under a master for several months, feeding only off of animals, and undergoing ceremonies seemingly reflective of Sufi ritual (which is what has gained Path adherents the nickname "dervishes"). You know that all adherents to the Path are supposed to be branded permanently with the Enochian glyph for death, and that as they advance on the Path, other tattoos an symbols may be added to the pattern, often using tools made from the fangs and claws of slain enemies. (CtB: 35-39)

    <li class="list-group-item">
	You know that the Path of Caine is a result of "heretical" devotees of the Path of Blood who chose to exalt the teachings of Caine over those of Haqim after uncovering certain Noddist texts. You are aware that this movement has been said to have been one of the bolstering forces on the Anarchs' side during the Anarch Revolt. You further know that the large majority of modern practitioners of this Path of Enlightenment rank among the Assamite antitribu. (CtB: 43-48)

	You know all of the current members of the Council of Scrolls and have heard of Sarah Schneier (Seat of Copper and Lightning) who was destroyed for her part in the Schism under mysterious circumstances. (CbA [Rev]: 39, 99-100; Assamites.com)

    <li class="list-group-item">
	You have heard that the Schismatics have digitally preserved the Alamut libraries which Ur-Shulgi ordered sealed, and that great magical defenses have been put in place to preserve them. (CbA [Rev]: 100)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You know that the Assamites superficial similarities to the historical assassin group known as the Hashashin is not purely coincidental, and that the organization was said to have been created by a rogue Assamite ghoul Hassan-i-Sabah, also known as the False Haqim. (LS3: 62-63)
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
	You know that the Heartsblood could be used to recall the blood of any Cainite who has had their blood added to it, and that using this power, another Assamite could work magic upon them from Alamut through this. You further know that it was said to grant divine insight to any who drank of it. (CbA: 25; LS3: 76-77)

	You have heard of the Web of Knives, an elite secret assassination organization within the Clan, although you know little about them. (CbA [Rev]: 59-60; PGttLC: 217-218; LS3: 62-63)
