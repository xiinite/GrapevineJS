        You know that the Giovanni seldom ever have successfully revealed the secrets of Necromancy to those outside of the Clan and family, either through prohibitive ritual magic, or through some affinity in the Giovanni blood that makes Necromancy diffuclt to teach to outsiders. (GC3 12)

        You have heard of the Jovians, the Roman merchant family that eventually developed into the Giovanni. You know that Giovanni Necromancy developed, in part, from the Jovians' practices of ancestor worship - in particular, their reverence for the Dis Pater (Father of Wealth), a powerful lar familiar of the household.

They are the Dunsirn of Scotland, the Pisanob of Mexico, and most recently, the Milliners of Boston. You know that the anziani almost universally give the Unico Sanguee preference in all affairs and this often leaves the lesser families embittered. (CbGi [Rev]: 28-29)

You further know that it will require a great deal of spiriti to perform, and that this is the reason that some Giovanni tithe wraiths. (CbGi: 14-15; CbGi [Rev]: 26-27, 42)
